<p class="nind">
<i><span class="smcap">Dear Toby</span></i>:<br />
</p>

<p><i>It is fitting, and I hope you will not feel
it otherwise, that your name should appear
on the forefront of this little book, for you
know best how much good humour went to
the making of it, and how when it was read
piecemeal, as it was written, to you, your
native politeness, which I cannot admire
too much, more than once prompted you to
laugh. (Advt.) You will remember, too,
when I first mentioned the idea of it to you,
that with some solemnity we procured a
large sheet of foolscap paper, and a blue
pencil, and then and there set ourselves to
put down all the remarkable and stirring
events which happened to us in those four
years we spent together at Cambridge; how
we failed egregiously to recollect anything
remarkable or stirring&mdash;pardon me, we remembered
one stirring event, but decided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_iv" id="page_iv">{iv}</a></span>not to treat the world to it&mdash;which had
come within our personal experience, and
thereupon cast, or as you said, “speired”
about for any remarkable and stirring incident,
which had happened, not, alas, to
us, but to anybody else soever. Here again
I may recall to you that we drew blank,
and our sheet of paper was still virgin
white, our blue pencil as sharp as ever, and
the book no nearer conception than before.</i></p>

<p><i>Then it was that the uncomfortable conviction
dawned on us, gradually illuminating
our minds as some cloudy rain-slanted
morning grows clear to half-wakened eyes,
that in the majority of cases, remarkable
and stirring events do not befall the undergraduate,
and that if the book was to be
made at all, it must be made of homely,
and I hope wholesome, ingredients, a cricket
ball, a canoe, a football, a tripos, a don, a
croquet mallet, a few undergraduates, a
Greek play, some work, and so forth. For
it seemed to us that the superficial enquirer&mdash;and
you, I vow, are even more superficially-minded
than I&mdash;finds that these
things are common to the experience of most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_v" id="page_v">{v}</a></span>men, but that when you begin to deal in
spiritualities, heroes, century-making captains
of eleven, chess blues, and higher
aspirations, you desert the normal plane
for the super-normal, where people like
you and me have no business to intrude.</i></p>

<p><i>So that, now it is complete, you will find
therein neither births, deaths, nor marriages,
and though the <span class="un">Babe</span> himself may have
waxed a little out of proportion to our
original scheme&mdash;he ought, for instance,
never to have played Rugby for his University,
as savouring too much of the hero&mdash;I
have retained for him to the end that
futility of mind, and girt him about with
that flippant atmosphere, in which the
truly heroic chokes and stifles. About the
other characters I have no such confessions
to make; they have successfully steered
clear of all distinctions, bodily or mental;
I have even omitted to state <span class="un">Ealing’s</span> place
in the tripos, and for this reason. He
ought to have done better than the <span class="un">Babe</span>,
but the <span class="un">Babe</span> got a second, and this leaves
only one class where Ealing’s name would
reasonably appear, and I altogether refuse
to let him take a first.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Good-bye for the present: but you will be
home for leave, will you not, in a month?</i></p>

<p class="r">
<span style="margin-right: 6em;"><i>Believe me, my dear Toby,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 4em;"><i>Ever your sincere friend,</i></span><br />
<i>E. F. BENSON.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>P. S.&mdash;I apologise for what I have said
about your superficialness. It is, however,
perfectly true.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vii" id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">And</span> I maintain,” said Reggie, flourishing
the Britannia-metal teapot (in order,
it is supposed, to lend a spurious
emphasis to the <i>banalité</i> of his sentiment),
“that it’s better to have played and lost
than never&mdash;”</p>

<p>The teapot&mdash;one of those in which the
handle is invariably the hottest part&mdash;had
just been filled up with boiling water, and
a clear and fervid amber stream flew
bounteously out of its spout on to the
bare knees of one of those who had
played and lost. Thereupon a confused
noise arose, and Reggie’s sentence has
never been finished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span></p>

<p>After a short but violent interlude, the
confused noise ceased by tacit consent, as
suddenly as it had begun; Ealing helped
Reggie to pick up the broken fragments
that remained, and the latter had to drink
his tea out of a pint glass.</p>

<p>“To think that a mere game of football
should lead to such disastrous consequences,”
he remarked. “Why does tea
out of a glass taste like hot Gregory
powder?”</p>

<p>“I never drank hot Gregory powder;
what does it taste like?”</p>

<p>“Why, like tea out of a glass,” said
Reggie brilliantly.</p>

<p>“Reggie, if you want to rag again,
you’ve only got to say so.”</p>

<p>Ealing threw into a corner the napkin
with which he had been drying his knees
and stocking after the tea-deluge, and as
he had finished, took out a pipe, and proceeded
to fill it.</p>

<p>“That pig of a half-back caught me a
frightful hack on the shin,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, you kicked him in the stomach
later on,” said Reggie consolingly. “Tha<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span>t’s
always something to fall back on. Besides
he did it by accident, and it certainly
looked as if you did it on purpose. Of
course it may only have been sheer clumsiness.”</p>

<p>“Dry up. You didn’t funk as much
as usual this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I tried to, but I never had time. And
I can funk as quickly as any man in England.
Jack, it’s time for you to say
something.”</p>

<p>Jack Marsden was the only one of the
three who looked in the least like a gentleman
at that moment. Ealing and Reggie
were both in change, they both wore
villainously muddy flannel knickerbockers,
short enough to disclose villainously muddy
knees, old blazers, and strong, useful, football
boots with bars. Jack, who had taken
no part in the confused noise, was sitting
in a low chair reading <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>,
and eating cake in the manner of a
man who does not think about dinner.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t asleep,” he remarked. “I
heard every word you fellows were saying.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Dormouse,” explained Ealing.</p>

<p>“Dormouse it is. Give me some more
tea, Reggie.”</p>

<p>“I call it so jolly sociable to read a book
when you come to tea,” remarked Reggie.</p>

<p>“So do I. Thanks. And another piece
of cake.”</p>

<p>“Football’s a beastly game,” said Ealing.</p>

<p>“Especially when one is beaten. Here
we are out of the Cup ties in the first
round, and what one is to do now I don’t
know. I can’t think why people ever play
football.”</p>

<p>“I shall work,” said Ealing. “Have
you seen the list of the subjects for the
Mays? I think it must be meant for a
joke. They have set all the classical authors
I ever heard of, and nearly all I
haven’t ever heard of.”</p>

<p>“I want a clean cup,” quoted Jack.</p>

<p>“You want a clean&mdash;” began Reggie
slowly in a tone of virulent condemnation.
But being unable to finish his sentence in
an adequately insulting manner, he left
Jack’s deficiencies to the imagination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span></p>

<p>“He wants a clean pipe,” remarked
Ealing. “It sounds like a kettle boiling.”</p>

<p>Jack shut up his book and yawned.</p>

<p>“You fellows are beastly funny,” he
said. “I’m going back to Trinity to
work. For why? I am dining with the
Babe to-night.”</p>

<p>“The Babe has got markedly madder
and several years younger since last term,”
said Ealing. “And he was neither sane
nor old to begin with. Tell him so with
my love. Or I dare say Reggie and I
will come round later.”</p>

<p>“Do. It is November the fifth. The
Babe observes all feasts, whether civil or
ecclesiastical. He says it would be a
thousand pities to let these curious old
customs lapse into disuse.”</p>

<p>“I wish the Babe wouldn’t use such
beautiful language,” said Ealing.</p>

<p>“He only does it in his less lucid intervals.
Good-bye. I’ll tell him you’re
coming round about ten.”</p>

<p>Jack picked up his hat and stick and
went off to his rooms in Trinity, where
till half-past seven he drifted helplessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span>
about like a ship-wrecked mariner, to
whom no sail breaks the limitless horizon,
in Thucydides’s graphic account of the
Peloponnesian war. To Jack, however,
it appeared that its chief characteristic
was its length, rather than its interest, a
criticism, the truth of which is rendered
more and more probable every year by an
enormous mass of perfectly independent,
unbiassed critics. But being a short and
stout young man, by no means infirm of
purpose, he regarded that merely as a
reason the more for beginning at once.</p>

<p>Reggie Bristow and Ealing sat on for
an hour or so by the fire. They were old
friends, and so they did not need to talk
much. Reggie was a year the younger of
the two, and he was now half-way through
his first term at King’s. They had been at
Eton five years together, where they had
both extracted a good deal of amusement
out of life, and perhaps a little profit.
They were both exceedingly healthy, to
judge by the superficial standards of examinations,
rather stupid, and, in the
opinion of those who knew them, on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span>
much more important matter, very liveable-with.
Furthermore, they both played
games rather well, and, as was right,
neither of them ever troubled his head
about abstract questions of any sort or
kind. Living was pleasant, and they proceeded
to live.</p>

<p>Reggie had been performing this precarious
feat with admirable steadiness for
just nineteen years. Nature had gifted
him with a pleasant face, and a healthy
appetite had enabled him to show it to
eminent advantage on the top of a tall
body. He preferred talking to working,
cricket to football, and lying in bed to
“signing in” at 8 <small>A.M.</small> in the morning.
He smoked a good many pipes every day,
and blew smoke rings creditably. He
played the piano a little, but his friends
did not encourage him to take the necessary
practice whereby he might play it
any better. He was in fact perfectly
normal, which is always the best thing
to be.</p>

<p>“It’s a great bore, our being beaten,”
he said, after a long pause, during which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span>
he had succeeded in blowing one smoke
ring through another. “We were the
best side really.”</p>

<p>“Of course we were, although we are
blessed with a goal-keeper who hides
behind the goal-posts, until a man has had
his shot.”</p>

<p>“He stopped rather a hot one to-day.”</p>

<p>“Purely by accident. He peeped out
from the goal-post too soon, and it struck
him in the stomach. I hate being beaten
by Pemmer, though I shouldn’t have
minded if we’d lost to Trinity. The
ground was in a filthy state too. One
couldn’t get off.”</p>

<p>Reggie sighed.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to write to my father to-morrow,”
he said, “and tell him my impressions
of Cambridge. It will be a
little difficult, because I haven’t got any.”</p>

<p>“Of course you haven’t. Only people
in books have impressions. Describe the
match to-day.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it wouldn’t interest him.”</p>

<p>“Well, describe King’s Chapel.”</p>

<p>“I might do that; perhaps he’s for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span>gotten
what it is like. Oh, yes, and I
might describe some of the dons. I’m
expected to be very earnest, you know,
and the worst of it is I don’t know how.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose one will ever become
a responsible being?” asked Ealing.</p>

<p>“No, never,” said Reggie emphatically.
“I grow sillier and sillier every day.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t get much sillier.”</p>

<p>Reggie shook his head.</p>

<p>“You wait a year or two,” he said. “I
don’t suppose you can form the slightest
impression of how foolish I can be if I
like.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do when you
go down?”</p>

<p>“The Lord knows,” said Reggie. “I
was considered remarkably bright for my
age at one time.”</p>

<p>“Long ago?”</p>

<p>“Ages ago. I don’t suppose I’ve been
considered bright for the last six years. Oh,
by the way, they’ve put me into the Pitt.”</p>

<p>“How very imprudent of them!”</p>

<p>“Yes. There was a young man in the
Pitt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“That’s all. It’s me, you know.”</p>

<p>Ealing got up and stretched slowly and
luxuriously.</p>

<p>“I must go and change. I believe one
oughtn’t to sit in wet things. But if one
does it frequently enough, it doesn’t seem
to hurt one, and the same remark applies
to muffins.”</p>

<p>“I shall try sitting in a muffin,” said
Reggie thoughtfully. “I never thought
of it before.”</p>

<p>“Do. Are you going into Hall to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, unless you ask me to dinner.”</p>

<p>“I have no intention whatever of doing
that,” said Ealing.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll both go into Hall. I
propose to drink champagne out of a silver
mug to make up for the tea out of a
glass.”</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Not what I wish but what I want,’
as the Babe said the other day when he
ordered six pairs of silk pyjamas.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Babe has his points,” said
Reggie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span></p>

<p>Reggie’s rooms looked out on to a
small court, bounded on two sides by the
new college buildings, on one by that
pellucid river, from which, as Wordsworth
might have said, “Cambridge has
borrowed its name,” and on the other by
four or five big elm-trees. Beyond these
lay the back lawn, growing a little rank
just now with autumn rains, and above
that the main buildings of the college,
and the Chapel, which is quite worth describing
even to the length of four sides
of that smaller size of note-paper, which is
found so eminently convenient a basis for
the purpose of writing letters to relations.</p>

<p>His two rooms were on the third floor,
opening the one into the other, and like
all college rooms, were very thoughtfully
supplied with an outer door which could
only be opened from the inside, and by
means of which the laborious student can
shut himself off from sight and sound of
the busy world around. During Reggie’s
short stay at Cambridge it had, as far as
he knew, only been used once, and on
that occasion a playful friend, mistaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span>
its real use, had shut him out, having previously
ascertained that he had lost the
key. This feat has at least the merit of
simplicity, and it appears to lose none of its
fascination however constantly repeated.</p>

<p>Inside, they were furnished with a small
bookcase, occupied by débutant-looking
classical books, several low chairs, which
may best be described as rather groggy,
and had been taken on from the previous
owner at a high valuation, a piano
of a harsh and astringent quality of tone,
but plenty of it, several high chairs,
and two tables. The smaller of these
Reggie preferred to call his working table,
the only explanation of which seemed
to lie in the fact that somebody often sat
on the edge of it when the chairs were
full. Two or three school groups and a
couple of engravings hung on the walls,
and the chimney-piece was littered with
things which reminded one of the delightfully
vague word “remnants,” and consisted
of candlesticks, pipes, old letters, loose
matches, an ash tray, a clock which for
the last month had been under the delu<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span>sion
that it was always ten minutes to
four, an invitation to play in the Freshman’s
football match, and another to see
the Dean at five minutes to seven, a
watch and watch-chain, sixpence, a lawn-tennis
ball, a small wooden doll in hideous
nakedness (no explanation forthcoming),
a pen, and a cigarette.</p>

<p>It was a cold evening, and Reggie
wandered in and out of his bedroom, in
a state of betwixt and between, now clad
only in a bath towel, later on in a pair of
trousers and socks, in the fulness of time
completely clothed. It still wanted five
or ten minutes to seven, and he stood in
front of the fire warming himself till Hall
time, feeling in that deliciously half-tired,
half-lazy mood which is the inimitable
result of violent exercise. He rummaged
aimlessly in the débris on the mantel-piece,
and suffering the deserved fate of
idle hands, found the Dean’s note about
which he had genuinely forgotten. He
gave vent to a resigned little sound, about
half-way between a sigh and a swear, took
up his gown and left the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> Fellows of colleges, who live in
college are, for obvious reasons, debarred
from the matrimonial state, and should
inspire greater respect in reflective minds
than almost any other class of persons in
this naughty world. For the most part
they combine the morality of married men
with the innocence of ideal bachelors.
Their lives are for nine months or so of
the year lived in the sequestered shades
of pious and ancient foundations, unspotted
by the world. Those who have
relations fill their places in the domestic
circle where their absence has no doubt
rendered them doubly dear, at Christmas
and Easter, or join those who
have not, and pass their long vacation on
the lower slopes of the Alps, or at quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span>
little sea-side places; some of them visit
cathedrals during their unoccupied months,
some the lakes, few or none, London, or
if London, chiefly the reading-room at
the British Museum. But there are exceptions
to the most desirable rules, and
even among Fellows of colleges there are
a few who are reported to know “a thing
or two.”</p>

<p>On Saturday night it often happened
that Fellows of King’s asked their colleagues
from other colleges to dine with
them. After dinner they sat in the Combination
Room for an hour or so, or they
would break up into parties, which spent
the evening at one or other of the Fellows’
rooms, and indulged in the mild dissipation
of whist at three-penny points, which
they seemed to find strangely exhilarating.
One such party adjourned directly after
dinner to the room of the Dean, Mr.
Collins, who two hours before had remonstrated
with Reggie for not attending
a larger percentage of early Chapels or
their equivalent. To undergraduates he
was scholastic and austere, but among his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span>
own contemporaries he not infrequently
relaxed into positive playfulness.</p>

<p>Mr. Stewart, a history tutor from Trinity,
was one of his guests to-night, and
Mr. Longridge, a Dean of the same college,
another. About Mr. Longridge, all
that need be said at present is that in
body he was insignificant, and in mind,
incoherent. But Mr. Stewart was a more
conspicuous person both bodily and mentally:
he was in fact one of the exceptions
to the general run of his class, and he was
credited, by report at least, with knowing
not only a thing or two, but lots of
things.</p>

<p>Just now, his long, languid form, attired
altogether elegantly, was spread over
a considerable area of arm-chair, his feet
rested on the fender, and he was holding
forth on certain subjects of the day, about
which he was perfectly qualified to speak.
The man with the incoherent mind was
sitting near him, listening with ill-concealed
impatience to his sonorous periods,
and getting in a word edgewise occasionally.
Mr. Collins was busy attending<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span>
to the wants of his guests, and two of his
friends from the same college, were sitting
together on the sofa, resigned but replete.</p>

<p>“The luxury of modern times,” Mr.
Stewart was saying, “is disgusting,&mdash;Chartreuse,
please&mdash;simply disgusting.
What business have men to clothe their
floors in fabrics from Persia, their walls
in other fabrics from Cairo and Algiers,
or stamped leather, and paintings by
Turner and Reynolds and, and Orchardson,
their lamp-shades in lace and Liberty
fabrics&mdash;Lace and Liberty sounds
like a party catch-word&mdash;and leave their
minds naked and unashamed? I myself
aim at a studious simplicity&mdash;Thank you,
I have brought my own cigarettes. Won’t
you have one? They are straight from
Constantinople&mdash;a studious simplicity. I
live at Cambridge, while my natural
sphere is London and Paris. I get up
at seven, while nature bids me stay in
bed till ten. I&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Longridge could not bear it any
longer. He sprang out of his chair as a
cuckoo flies out of a cuckoo clock on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span>
stroke of the hour, and adjusted his spectacles.</p>

<p>“Well, take the case of a man who, say,
lived at Oxford. Supposing&mdash;or well, take
another case&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Stewart took advantage of a momentary
pause to continue.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, very interesting,” he
said. “A delightful town, Oxford. A
shadow of the romance of mediævalism
still lingers about its grey streets, which
is quite absent from the new red-brick
buildings of St. John’s College, Cambridge.
I remember walking there one morning
with dear George Meredith, and your
mention of Oxford recalled to me what
he said. Poor dear fellow! He is the
most lucid of men, but as soon as he puts
pen to paper he is like an elephant that
is lost in a jungle, and goes trumpeting
and trampling along through wreaths and
tangled festoons of an exotic style. Lord
Granchester was staying there at the
time&mdash;Sir Reginald Bristow he was
then&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I had the pleasure of speaking to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span>
son just before Hall,” remarked Mr. Stewart
in professional accents.</p>

<p>“Reggie, is dear Reggie up here?
How delightful! I remember him six or
seven years ago. He was like one of
Raphael’s angels.”</p>

<p>“What-was-it-that-George-Meredith-said?”
asked the incoherent man, all in
one word.</p>

<p>“One of Raphael’s angels,” pursued
Mr. Stewart, taking not the slightest notice.
“A face like an opening flower.”</p>

<p>“The flower has a stem six feet high
now,” remarked Mr. Collins.</p>

<p>“Dear Reggie! And&mdash;and is he as
fascinating as ever?”</p>

<p>Mr. Collins laughed.</p>

<p>“I have not known him long, so I cannot
say how fascinating he is capable of
being. And as a rule Deans and undergraduates
don’t put out their full power
of fascination in dealing with each other.”</p>

<p>“But whose fault is that?” said Mr.
Stewart in a slow unctuous voice. “Surely
we ought to be brothers, dear elder brothers
to the undergraduates. I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span>&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Collins, who was obviously sceptical
about George Meredith’s remark, and
hoped that Stewart was going back to it,
brightened up and interrogated, “Yes?”
in an intelligent manner.</p>

<p>“I remember,” said Mr. Stewart still
sublimely oblivious, “I remember that
I myself used always to make friends,
dear friends of the undergraduates when
I was Dean. If one of them did not attend
Chapel often enough, as often, that
is, as our odious regulations require, I
used to ask him to call for me on his way,
and we used to go to Chapel together.
One had a rich, lovely tenor voice. I&mdash;I
forget his name, and I think he is dead.”</p>

<p>Mr. Longridge laughed monosyllabically
but unkindly.</p>

<p>“It was very pleasant, very pleasant
indeed, but to be Dean brings one into
the wrong relation with undergraduates,”
said Mr. Stewart. “And talking of music,
I had a charming time at Bayreuth last
year. We had <i>Parsifal</i> and <i>Tannhäuser</i>
and the <i>Meistersingers</i>. <i>Tannhäuser</i> is the
most wonderful creation. Like all of us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span>
but more successfully than most, Wagner
welds into one harmonious whole, the
ugliness of sin and the beauty of holiness.”</p>

<p>Mr. Longridge&mdash;there is no other word&mdash;bridled.</p>

<p>“The beauty of holiness,” continued
Mr. Stewart, chewing and masticating his
words, so as to get the full flavour out of
them, “a human soul capable of anything.
Venusberg and Rome are alike interludes
to him. He goes on his sublimely humorous
way from Venusberg to Elizabeth,
from Elizabeth to Venusberg, and neither
produces any lasting effect. And how
supremely natural the end is! He has
left an almond rod at Rome, and because
one of the pilgrims, one of a dowdy crew
of middle-class pilgrims shows him an
almond rod in blossom, he rushes to the
conclusion that it is his. How illogical,
but how natural! And he who has never
had the courage of his opinions either at
Venusberg or Rome, is ‘struck of a heap,’
as they say in suburban places, by the
flowering almond rod, and instantly gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span>
up the ghost. Maskelyne and Cooke
could produce a bundle of flowering
almond rods in half the time. We pay
five shillings to see them all. Tannhäuser
paid his life to see one. He died of joy
at the sight of that flowering almond rod.
And after all it was only artificial flowers
twined round a stick.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, if you choose to look
at it in that way,” ejaculated Mr. Longridge.</p>

<p>“My dear Longridge,” said Mr. Stewart
very slowly, “there is only one way
to look at things, only one way.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, though you might very
fairly say that there was only one man to
look at in one way. <i>Quot homines, tot
sententiæ.</i>”</p>

<p>“Dear old Longridge,” said Stewart
with unctuous affection.</p>

<p>“You might just as well say,” continued
Mr. Longridge, “that because there are
people who are colour-blind, we none of
us know green from red.”</p>

<p>There was perhaps nothing in the
world which Mr. Longridge enjoyed so<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span>
heartily as what he called a good, sharp
argument. This usually consisted in his
putting forward a great quantity of indefensible
and irrelevant propositions himself,
and then proceeding to show how
indefensible they were: their irrelevancy
needed no demonstration. He was a man
of mixed mind.</p>

<p>“Dear old Longridge,” repeated Stewart.
“Some people have the misfortune
to be born colour-blind, and no
doubt in the next world they will be
extraordinarily keen-sighted. But until
we have finished with this world, and I
have not, we can leave colour-blind people
altogether out of the question, can we
not? In fact, I don’t know how they
found their way in. Some things are
green, others red, and if you call them by
their wrong names, even your own friends
must allow that you are no judge of colour.”</p>

<p>Mr. Longridge who was very near-sighted,
seemed disposed to take this
personally.</p>

<p>“But because I differ from you, <i>in toto</i>
I may say, that is no proof that I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span>
colour-blind. You might just as well say&mdash;well,
to take another instance&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To take another instance,” said Mr.
Stewart, “because you are sleepy, that is
no reason why I should go to bed. In
fact, I will have just a glass more of Chartreuse.
What a lovely colour it is. A
decadent, abnormal colour, the colour of
a spoiled piece of soul-fabric. Yes, quite
delicious. I spent a fortnight once in the
monastery at Fécamp, full of dear, delightful,
ascetic monks. I think they all put
boiled peas in their shoes during the day,
which must be horribly squashy, but they
all drink Chartreuse after dinner, so they
end happily. Dear, impossible Charles
Kingsley used always to abuse monks&mdash;I
suppose because he was tinged with asceticism
himself. But I fancy there is no
real objection to their marrying. Monks
marry nuns, I think. How delightful to
receive an invitation card&mdash;‘Monk and
Nun Stewart.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>The two other Fellows of King’s had
subsided into the background altogether,
and were discussing the chances of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span>
various pupils in the next tripos. They
had both refused Chartreuse, and took
their coffee in a mixture of half and half
with hot milk. The integral calculus on
one side balanced an exceptional skill at
Greek Iambics on the other, and they
prattled on politely and innocently. It
must be conceded that they felt but little
interest in what they were talking about,
but their interest on all subjects was diminutive
and bird-like. They pecked and
hopped away.</p>

<p>“But he showed me a copy of Iambics
the other day,” said one, “with two final
Cretics in it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stewart caught the last words.</p>

<p>“What an epigram that ought to
make!” he said, smiling broadly and
benignly. “The insidious and final
Cretic. I see him as a lean, spare man,
with a cast in his eye.”</p>

<p>“It’s merely a false foot in Greek Iambics
they are talking of,” said Longridge
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“And a false foot,” continued Stewart,
“cunningly concealed by patent leather<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span>
boots. Thank you, Longridge, the picture
is complete. And I have a Victor
Hugo class in my room at half-past ten.
We are reading <i>Les Misérables</i>&mdash;a&mdash;a
prose epic. I must literally be going.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see a figurative going,”
said Mr. Longridge, spitefully.</p>

<p>Mr. Stewart turned on him with mild
forbearance.</p>

<p>“You can say you must be going and
then stop,” he said. “Good night, good
night. A most pleasant evening.”</p>

<p>There were now only four of them, so
at their host’s proposal they settled down
to whist. Mr. Longridge enquired eagerly
whether it was to be long whist or short
whist, but as no one had ever heard of
either, it is to be presumed that they
played medium, and it is certain they
played mediocre whist. Mr. Longridge
during the first deal, demonstrated quite
conclusively that whist markers could be
used either for whist or backgammon or
bézique, always supposing you knew how
to multiply by ten, or with somewhat less
ease for registering the votes in the pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span>ent
election. This latter, however, appeared,
as far as it was possible to follow
him, to imply a knowledge of how to multiply
by thirteen and divide by twenty-nine,
a feat which all his hearers, with
the exception of the mathematician, were
hopelessly incapable of performing. This,
however, was no detraction whatever from
the abstract value of such a discovery.</p>

<p>Longridge was partner to Mr. Campbell,
one of the hitherto silent guests, and
Collins to Currey, who was cursed with
the final Cretic pupil. And herein lay the
sting of the affair, for Longridge’s studies
in whist had got as far as the call for
trumps, while his partner’s knowledge
was confined to a complete acquaintance
with the ordinal value of individual cards.
Collins, however, was a sound player, and
the only one present, excepting Longridge,
who knew what a call for trumps
meant. Longridge consequently stripped
his hand naked, as it were, for the sole
benefit of his adversary. The rest were
as Teiresias, struck blind by the sight of
five trumps unveiled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span></p>

<p>With his habitual acumen the Dean of
Trinity perceived this during the second
rubber, and without communicating his
discovery, as he was strongly tempted to
do, played the higher of two cards instead
of the lower so persistently in the first
round, in order to deceive his adversary
on the right, that before the game was
three deals old he had irrevocably revoked.
Holding the knave and nine of
clubs he played the higher of the two on
to the queen third hand, and deceived by
his own acuteness supposed he had no
more, and trumped the second round.
Whereby his adversaries went out, a
treble.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reggie and Ealing, meantime, had
spent a charming evening. Reggie had
been pressed not to play the piano after
Hall, and, instead, they had played billiards
till just before ten, and then gone
round to Malcolm Street to come down
to dessert at the Babe’s dinner party.</p>

<p>As it was Guy Fawkes’s day, their course,
so to speak, was mapped out for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span>
beyond possibility of error, and Reggie
had the prospect of being exactly six shillings
and eight-pence poorer than he
otherwise would have been, at about
10.30 on Monday morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Babe was a cynical old gentleman
of twenty years of age, who played the
banjo charmingly. In his less genial moments
he spoke querulously of the monotony
of the services of the Church of
England, and of the hopeless respectability
of M. Zola. His particular forte
was dinner parties for six, skirt dancing
and acting, and the performances of the
duties of half-back at Rugby football.
His dinner parties were selected with the
utmost carelessness, his usual plan being
to ask the first five people he met, provided
he did not know them too intimately.
With a wig of fair hair, hardly
any rouge, and an ingénue dress, he was
the image of Vesta Collins, and that
graceful young lady might have practised
before him, as before a mirror. But far<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span>
the most remarkable point about the Babe,
considering his outward appearance and
other tastes, was his brilliance as a Rugby
football player. He was extraordinarily
quick with the ball, his passing was like a
beautiful dream, and he dodged, as was
universally known, like the devil. It was
a sight for sore eyes to see the seraphic,
smooth-faced Babe waltzing gaily about
among rough-bearded barbarians, pretending
to pass and doing nothing of the kind,
dropping neatly out of what looked like
the middle of the scrimmage, or flickering
about in a crowd which seemed to be unable
to touch him with a finger.</p>

<p>Last night the Babe had been completely
in his element. His dinner party
consisted of a rowing-blue, a man who
had been sent down from Oxford, a Dean
who was to preach the University sermon
next day, and was the Babe’s uncle, Jack
Marsden, a gentleman from Corpus, who
had a very rosy chance, so said his friends,
of representing Cambridge against Oxford
at chess, and himself. Later on, Reggie
and Ealing had come in, who with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span>
help of the rowing man broke both his
sofas; the gentleman from Oxford had insisted,
to the obvious discomfort of the
Dean, on talking to him about predestination,
a subject of which the Dean seemed
to know nothing whatever; the chess-man
had played bézique with Jack, and the
Babe had presided over them all with infantine
cynicism. A little later on, when
the Dean had gone away, he had danced
a skirt-dance in a sheet and a night-gown,
and they ended up the evening by what
the Babe called “a set piece” from his
window, consisting of a catherine wheel,
and four Roman candles, not counting the
rocket which exploded backwards through
the Babe’s chandelier, narrowly missing
the head of the man from Corpus, whose
chance of getting his chess-blue would, if
it had hit, have been totally extinguished.
In order to lend verisimilitude to the proceedings
Reggie had gone into the street
and called “Oh-h-h-h,” at intervals, and
as he had left his cap and gown in the
Babe’s room, he was very promptly and
properly proctorised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span></p>

<p>The Babe breakfasted next morning at
the civilised hour of ten, and observed
with a faint smile that the rocket stick
was deeply imbedded in the ceiling, and
he ate his eggs and bacon with a serene
sense of the successful incongruity of his
little party the night before. The gentleman
from Oxford who was staying with
him had not yet appeared, but the Babe
waited for no man, when he was hungry.</p>

<p>The furniture of his rooms was as various
and as diverse as his accomplishments.
Several of Mr. Aubrey Beardsley’s illustrations
from the Yellow Book, clustering
round a large photograph of Botticelli’s
Primavera, which the Babe had never
seen, hung above one of the broken sofas,
and in his bookcase several numbers of
the Yellow Book, which the Babe declared
bitterly had turned grey in a single night,
since the former artist had ceased to draw
for it, were ranged side by side with Butler’s
<i>Analogies</i>, Mr. Sponge’s <i>Sporting
Tour</i>, and Miss Marie Corelli’s <i>Barabbas</i>.
It is, however, only fair to the Babe to say
that Bishop Butler’s volume had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span>
part of the “set piece” for his Littlego,
and that he referred to Miss Corelli as
the arch humourist of English literature.
A pair of dumb-bells, each weighing fifty-six
pounds, stood by the fireplace, but
these the Babe had never been known to
use in order to further his muscular development;
he only rolled them over the
floor with the patient look of one who
had the destinies of the world on his
shoulders, whenever the lodger below
played the piano. It may be remarked
that the two were not on speaking terms.</p>

<p>“And herein,” said the Babe, when he
explained the use of the dumb-bells the
evening before, “herein lies half the bitterness
of human life.”</p>

<p>He was pressed to explain further, but
only replied sadly,</p>

<p>“So near and yet so far,” and showed
how it was possible to imitate the experience
of a sea-sick passenger on the channel,
by means of “that simple, and I may
add, delicious fruit, the common orange.”</p>

<p>It was a most realistic and spirited performance,
and all that the Dean could do<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span>
was to ejaculate feebly, “Do stop, Babe,”
between his spasms of laughter.</p>

<p>The Babe had finished his breakfast,
which he ate with a good appetite, heartily,
before the gentleman from Oxford appeared,
and proceeded to skim the <i>Sunday
Times</i>. When he did appear he looked a
little disconsolately at the breakfast table,
and lifting up a dish-cover found some cold
bacon, at which he blanched visibly, and
demanded soda water.</p>

<p>“What did you eat for breakfast,
Babe?” he asked.</p>

<p>The Babe looked up apologetically.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I ate all the eggs, and the
bacon must be cold by now,” he said. “But
I’ll send for some more.”</p>

<p>“No thanks. Where’s the tea?”</p>

<p>The Babe rang the bell.</p>

<p>“It’ll be here in a moment. I drank
cocoa.”</p>

<p>Leamington finished his soda water,
and sat down.</p>

<p>“There is no end to your greatness.
Cocoa! Great Scot! My tongue is the
colour of mortar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry. I feel quite well,
thanks. Will you have some Eno’s fruit
salts? I know my landlady’s got some,
because she offered me them the other
day when I had a cold. Here’s your tea.
Do you ever read the Pink ’un? It’s
funny without being prudish.”</p>

<p>Leamington poured out some tea.</p>

<p>“Don’t read, Babe; it’s unsociable.
Talk to me while I eat.”</p>

<p>The Babe put down the current copy
of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, and laid himself
out to be pleasant.</p>

<p>“There are some people coming to
lunch at two,” he said. “I rather think I
asked Reggie. Poor Reggie, he got
dropped on in a minute by the Proggins.
Oh, yes, and so is Stewart. Do you know
Stewart? He’s a don at Trinity, and is
supposed to be wicked. I wish someone
would suppose me to be wicked. But
I’m beginning to be afraid they never
will.”</p>

<p>“You must lose your look of injured
innocence or rather cultivate the injury at
the expense of the innocence. Grow a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span>
moustache; no one looks battered and
world-weary without a moustache.”</p>

<p>“I can’t. I bought some Allen’s Hair
Restorer the other day, but it only
smarted. I wonder if they made a mistake
and gave me Allen’s Antifat?”</p>

<p>“You don’t look as if they had,” said
Leamington, “at least it doesn’t look as
if it had had much effect. Wouldn’t it
take?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said the Babe. “I applied
it night and morning to my upper lip, and
it only smelt and smarted. I suppose you
can’t restore a thing that has never existed.
I think I shall be a clergyman, because
all clergymen cut their moustaches
off, and to do that you must have one.”</p>

<p>“I see. But isn’t that rather elaborate?”</p>

<p>“No means are elaborate if you desire
the end enough,” said the Babe sententiously.
“I shall marry too, because
married people are bald, and I’m sure I
don’t wonder.”</p>

<p>“So are babies.”</p>

<p>“Not in the same way, and don’t be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span>
personal. I can’t think of any other means
of losing the appearance of innocence.
Suggest some: you’ve been rusticated.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ve tried that, and it’s no use.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know what I was going
to say,” objected Leamington.</p>

<p>“I know I don’t. But I’ve tried it,”
said the wicked Babe. “I’ve even read
the Yellow Book through from cover to
cover, and as you see, framed the pictures
by Aubrey Beardsley. The Yellow Book
is said to add twenty years per volume to
any one’s life. Not at all. It has left me
precisely where it found me, whereas,
according to that, as I’ve read five volumes,
I ought to be, let’s see&mdash;five
times twenty, plus twenty&mdash;a hundred
and twenty. I don’t look it, you know.
It’s no use your telling me I do, because
I don’t. I have no illusions whatever
about the matter.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going to tell you anything
of the kind,” said Leamington. “But
you should take yourself more seriously.
I believe that is very aging.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span>”</p>

<p>The Babe opened his eyes in the wildest
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Why I take myself like Gospels and
Epistles,” he said. “The fault is that
no one else takes me seriously. You
would hardly believe,” he continued with
some warmth, “that the other night I
was proctorised, and that when the Proctor
saw who I was&mdash;he’s a Trinity man&mdash;he
said, ‘Oh, it’s only you. Go home
at once, Babe.’ It is perfectly disheartening.
I offered to let him search me to
see whether I had such a thing as a cap
or a gown concealed anywhere about me.
And the bull-dogs grinned. How can I
be a devil of a fellow, if I’m treated like
that?”</p>

<p>“I should have thought a Rugby blue
could have insisted on being treated properly.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s all part of the joke,”
shrieked the infuriated Babe. “It’s
supposed to add a relish to the silly
pointless joke of treating me like a child
and calling me ‘Babe.’ I’ve never been
called anything but Babe since I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span>
remember. And when I try to be proctorised
the very bull-dogs come about
me, making mouths at me.”</p>

<p>“Rough luck. Try it on again.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pure waste of time,” said the
Babe disconsolately. “I might go out
for a drive with all the bed-makers of
this college in a tandem, and no one
would take the slightest notice of me.
Besides I can never make a tandem go
straight. The leader always turns round
and winks at me. It knows perfectly
well that I’m only the Babe, bless its
heart. I edited a perfectly scandalous
magazine here last term you know, every
day during the May week. It simply
teemed with scurrilous suggestiveness.
It insulted directly every one with whom
I was acquainted, and many people with
whom I was not. It compared the Vice-Chancellor
to an old toothbrush, and
drew a trenchant parallel between the
Proctors and the town drainage. It suggested
that the antechapel of King’s
should be turned into a shooting-gallery,
and the side chapels into billiard-rooms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span>
It proposed that I should be appointed
Master of Magdalen, I forget why at
this moment. It contained the results
of a <i>plébiscite</i> as to who should be Vice-Chancellor
for the next year, and the
under-porter of King’s got in easily, with
Jack Marsden as a bad second. It proposed
the substitution of dominoes and
hopscotch&mdash;I haven’t the least idea what
hopscotch is, but it sounds to me simply
obscene&mdash;for the inter-university contests
at cricket and rowing. And that magazine,”
said the Babe dramatically, rising
from his chair, and addressing Primavera,
“that magazine was welcomed, welcomed,
Madam, by all classes. The innocent
lambs, whose reputation I ought to have
ruined came bleating after me and said
how they had enjoyed it. It sold by
hundreds, when it ought to have been
suppressed: people thought it funny,
whereas it was only hopelessly foolish
and vulgar, though I say it who shouldn’t;
while those few people who had the sense
to see how despicable the whole production
really was, told each other that ‘it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span>
was only Me.’ Me! I’m almost sick of
the word. I was put ‘in Authority’ in
the Granta, when I ought to have been
sent down&mdash;The Vice-Chancellor asked
me to dinner on the very day when I
published a most infernal and libellous
lampoon about him, and I have already
told you how the Proctors treat me. It
is enough,” said the Babe in conclusion,
“to make one take the veil, I mean the
tonsure, and dry up the milk of human
kindness within one.”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear,” shouted Leamington.
“Good old Babe.”</p>

<p>The Babe glared at him a moment, with
wide, indignant eyes and then went on
rather shrilly:</p>

<p>“Look at Reggie. I’m older than he is,
at least I think so, and any one with a grain
of sense would say that I therefore ought
to know better, and what is excusable in
him, is not excusable in me, but he goes
and says ‘Oh’ in the street and he is
treated as a dangerous character, sent
home, and will be fined. I might say ‘Oh’
till Oscar Browning got into Parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span>
and do you suppose they would ever consider
me a dangerous character? Not
they. (Here the Babe laughed in a hollow
and scornful manner.) They would
treat me with that infernal familiarity
which I so deprecate, and say, ‘Go home,
Babe.’ Babe indeed!”</p>

<p>The Babe’s voice broke, and he flung
himself into his chair after the manner
of Sarah Bernhardt, and hissed out “<i>Misérables!
Comme je les déteste!</i>”</p>

<p>Leamington applauded this histrionic
effort, and feeling a little better after
breakfast, lit a cigarette. The maidservant
came to clear breakfast away, and
as she left the room the Babe resumed in
the gentle, melancholy tones, which were
natural to him:</p>

<p>“If I thought it would do any good, I
would go and snatch a kiss from that
horrid, rat-faced girl as she is carrying
the tray down stairs. But it wouldn’t,
you know; it wouldn’t do any good at
all. She wouldn’t complain to the landlady,
or if she did it would only end
in my giving her half-a-crown. Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span>
I don’t in the least want to kiss her&mdash;I
wouldn’t do it if she gave me half-a-crown.
I wonder what George Moore
would do if he were me. We’ll ask
Stewart when he comes to lunch. He
is intimate with all notable people.
George Moore is notable isn’t he? I
fancy W. H. Smith &amp; Son boycotted him.
Stewart said the other day that the Emperor
of Germany was one of the nicest
emperors he had ever seen.”</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” said Leamington.
“There’s a don at Oxford who has written
a book called <i>Princes I have Persecuted
without Encouragement</i>.”</p>

<p>The Babe laughed.</p>

<p>“A companion volume to Stewart’s
<i>Monarchs I have Met</i>. Not that he has
written such a book. Stewart is perfectly
charming, but he thinks a lot of a Prince.
If he hasn’t written <i>Monarchs I have
Met</i>, he ought to have.”</p>

<p>“We all ought to have done a lot of
things we haven’t done,” said Leamington.</p>

<p>“We had a butler once,” said the Babe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span>
“who never would say the General Confession,
because he said he hadn’t left
undone the things he ought to have done,
and it went against his conscience to say
he had. He got the sack soon after for
leaving the door of the cellar undone, and
for getting drunk.”</p>

<p>“So he was undone himself.”</p>

<p>“When I grow up,” said the Babe with
less bitterness, but returning like a burned
moth to the sore subject&mdash;no charge for
mixed metaphors&mdash;“I shall live exclusively
in the society of archdeacons.
Perhaps they might think me wicked.
Yet I don’t know&mdash;my uncle whom you
met last night thinks I’m such a good
boy, and he’s a dean.”</p>

<p>“I doubt if they would. The other
day some one sent a telegram to the
Archdeacon of Basingstoke, a man of
whom he knew nothing except that he
was a teetotaller and an anti-vivisectionist,
saying, ‘Fly at once, all is discovered.’
The Archdeacon flew, and has never been
heard of since. No one has the slightest
idea where he has gone or what he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span>
done. You know you wouldn’t fly, Babe,
if you were sent telegrams like that by
the hundred.”</p>

<p>“How little you know me,” said the
Babe dramatically. “I should fly like
fun. Don’t you see if one flew, one’s
character for wickedness would be established
beyond all doubt. I might send a
telegram to myself, telling me to fly.
Then I should fly, but leave the telegram
lying about in a conspicuous position.
After a year’s absence I should return,
but my character would be gone
beyond all hopes of recovery, and the
world would do me justice at last.”</p>

<p>“Poor misunderstood Babe! Why don’t
you go to Oxford, saying you’ve been
sent down from Cambridge? What time
do we lunch?”</p>

<p>“Oh, about two, and it’s half-past twelve
already. Let’s go round to the Pitt.
This evening we will go to Trinity
Chapel. A little walk is very wholesome
after breakfast. Besides I shall go in a
bowler, and perhaps we shall meet at
Proggins. I shall insult him if we do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Babe hurt his knee playing against
the Old Leysians, and his language was
Aristophanic and savoured strongly of
faint praise. Also one of the Old Leysians
had grossly insulted him during the
course of the game. The Babe was careering
about with the ball behind their
touch-line, attempting to get a try straight
behind the goal-posts, instead of being
content with one a reasonable distance
off, for he was fastidious in these little
matters and liked to do things well, when
he was caught up bodily by one of the
opposing team and carried safely out into
the field again. A roar of appreciative
laughter, and shouts of “Good old Babe”
went up from all the field, and the Babe’s
feelings were hurt. He had the satisfac<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span>tion
of dropping a goal a little later on,
but he asked pathetically, “Could aught
atone?”</p>

<p>Before “Time” was called he had hurt
his knee, and as already mentioned he was
Aristophanic for a few days.</p>

<p>The next match was against Blackheath,
and the Babe had not yet recovered sufficiently
to play. He had bought an Inverness
cloak “so loud,” he said, “that you
could scarcely hear yourself speak,” and
a cross-eyed bull-pup, in order to dispel
that universal but distressing illusion about
his childishness, which so vexed his soul,
and he was going to lunch with Reggie
and look at the match afterwards. Bill
Sykes, the bull-dog, was coming too, in
order to be seen with the Babe by as
many people as possible, and his master
drove to King’s gate with his Inverness
and his bull-dog, and his seraphic smile,
in the best of tempers. It was necessary
to smuggle Mr. Sykes, as the Babe insisted
that strangers should call him,
through the court without his being seen,
and the Babe hobbled along, still being<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span>
rather lame, presenting a curious lopsided
appearance which was caused by Mr.
Sykes, who was tucked away beneath the
Inverness. A confused growling sound
issued at intervals from somewhere below
his left arm, drowning even the loudness
of the Inverness, and the Babe murmured
encouragement and threats alternately.
The porter stared suspiciously at this odd
figure as it passed, but the serenity of the
Babe’s smile was as infinite as ever.</p>

<p>The Babe’s hansom had been told to
wait at the back gate of King’s, but it
had apparently found waiting tedious, and
as there were no others about, they had
to walk. Mr. Sykes, however, took this
opportunity to behave, as the Babe said,
“like the dog of a real blood,” and had
a delightful turn-up with a mongrel gentleman
of his acquaintance, which did him
much credit.</p>

<p>The game had not yet begun when they
reached the Corpus ground, and both
Sykes and the Babe’s cloak can hardly
have failed to be noticed. The Babe
hobbled about among the two teams who<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span>
were kicking about before the game began,
and said it was much pleasanter
looking on than playing, and that he
meant to give it up, as it was a game
more suited to savages than gentlemen.
Two of the home team resented these
remarks, and removed him, kindly but
firmly, beyond the touch-line.</p>

<p>He and Reggie had secured chairs
towards the centre of the ground, and it
pleased the Babe to affect a childlike
ignorance of everything connected with
the rules and regulations of Rugby football,
and he kept up a flow of fatuous
remarks.</p>

<p>“Look how they are throwing the ball
about! Why do they do that, Reggie?
Which side is getting the best of it?
Look at that funny little man with a flag,
why do they all stop when he holds it up?
I suppose it must be the captain. Have
they got any try-downs yet, or do you
call them touches? Oh, the ball’s coming
over here. I wish they’d take more care;
it might easily have hit me. Why don’t
they have a better one? It’s got all out<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span>
of shape; it isn’t a bit round. Mr. Sykes
wants to play too. What a darling! Bite
it then! How rough they are! Why
did Hargreaves stamp on that man so?”</p>

<p>The effect of Hargreaves’ “stamping on
that man” was that he got the ball and a
nice clear run. He was playing three
quarters on the right, and when he got
fairly off he was as fast as any man in
England. His weak point, however, was
starting: he could not start full speed as
the Babe did, being heavy and a trifle
clumsy. But he got twenty yards clear
now, and making the most of it he was
well off before the Blackheath team realised
what was happening.</p>

<p>The Babe’s fatuities died away as Hargreaves
started and he stood silent a moment.
It was clear that there was a good
opening to hand, barring accidents. The
game was close to the University twenty-five
on the far side of the ground, and the
Blackheath three-quarters were for the
moment much too close to the scrimmage.
It was impossible to get through even
with the most finished passing on that side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span>
and Hargreaves ran right across parallel
to the goal disregarding the possibility of
being collared in the centre of the ground
opposite to the home goal, but trusting
to his own speed. The outside Blackheath
three-quarters came racing along, running
slightly back in order to tackle him as he
turned, but in a few moments it was clear
that he was outpaced. Hargreaves ran
clear round him as a yacht clears the buoy
with a few yards to spare.</p>

<p>“Oh, well run,” shouted the Babe.
“Don’t pass; get in yourself.”</p>

<p>Hargreaves and the Blackheath back
were now close to each other about the
level of the Blackheath twenty-five, and
nearly in the middle of the ground. The
Varsity centre three-quarters had run
straight up the ground while Hargreaves
ran round, and was now in a position to be
passed to again, but two Blackheath three-quarters
were close to him. Then, by a
fatal error, Hargreaves wavered a moment,
instead of again trusting to his pace, got
tackled, and in that moment of slack speed
his own centre three-quarters got in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span>
of him. He passed wildly and forward.
An appeal, a whistle, a flag, and a free
kick.</p>

<p>“Damn,” said the Babe in a loud,
angry voice.</p>

<p>The game flickered about between the
two twenty-fives for the next ten minutes,
going fast and loose, with a good deal of
dribbling on the part of the forwards, and
a corresponding amount of self-immolation
on the part of the halves, who hurled
themselves recklessly on the ball in the
face of the fastest rushes, and seemed to
the unaccustomed eye to be feverishly
courting a swift and muddy death. Hargreaves
made a few futile attempts to run
through and failed egregiously.</p>

<p>Half-time was called shortly afterwards,
neither team having scored. The Babe
hobbled out into the field to make himself
unpleasant to his side. Mr. Sykes followed,
wheezing pathetically, and the
Babe’s Inverness cloak came in for renewed
comments and reproof.</p>

<p>“They are weak on the outside,” said
the sage Babe to Hargreaves, “and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span>
great man like you can run round as easy
as perdition. You ought to stand much
wider, and if you think you can get through
the centre you are wrong. Stoddard could
stop fifty of you. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>The Blackheath team had come to the
same conclusion as the Babe, and they
kept the game tight. They had quite
realised that the Varsity three-quarters on
the left was weak, and that Hargreaves on
the right was abominably fast. In consequence
they did their best to screw the
scrimmage round to Hargreaves’ side, so
as to hamper him by not leaving him room
to get off. Time after time his half fed him
persistently, and time after time he was
unable to get round between the touch-line
and the forwards. Meantime, the
Blackheath pack, which were heavier and
rather better together than Cambridge,
were working their way slowly and steadily
down the ground, keeping the ball close
and comfortable among them. Hargreaves
again and again, following the
Babe’s advice, stood right away on the
left of the scrimmage when it approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span>
the right touch-line, but his <i>vis-à-vis</i> as
regularly stood close to him, and embraced
him affectionately but roughly as soon as
the ball got to him and before he had time
to pass; but for the next quarter the game
was very tight, and with the exception of
a couple of free kicks given for offside
play among the Blackheath forwards, the
ball rarely left the scrimmage. Even
these were returned by the back into
touch, and the forwards settled down on
the ball again like swarming bees.</p>

<p>The Babe, meantime, had been insolent
to the referee, who was an old friend, and
also an old hand. He had gone so far as
to leave the game to take care of itself
for a moment to tell the Babe candidly
and in a loud, clear voice that he should
be severely treated afterwards, adding as a
further insult, “Of course we all know it’s
only you.” The Babe was furious but impotent.
The glory of the ulster and the
bull-pup was entirely neutralised.</p>

<p>But he soon forgot these insolences;
there were only ten minutes left, and
neither side had scored more than minor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span>
points. To the unprofessional eye it
seemed likely that they might go on playing
for hours like this without either side
scoring. The Blackheath forwards gained
ground very slowly, but this was made up
for with tiresome monotony by the quick
punting of the University halves whenever
they got the chance. The three-quarters
stood and shivered, and the University
back declared bitterly and audibly that he
might as well have stopped at home.</p>

<p>But the professional Babe knew better.
If once the ball came fairly out, the three-quarters
would have a look in, and for
himself he placed his money on Hargreaves.
And in defiance of law, order,
and decorum he shouted his advice to the
half who was playing substitute for him.</p>

<p>“Don’t punt,” he shouted, “but pass.”</p>

<p>The half at that moment was busy
punting, and the Babe repeated his advice.
Two minutes afterwards the half
took it, as an exceptional opportunity presented
itself, and passed to his centre
three-quarters, and the Babe stood on his
chair. Centre ran a short way and passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span>
to the left, who passed back to centre,
and centre to right. It was as pretty a
piece of passing as one would wish to see
on a winter’s day.</p>

<p>This was the moment for which the
Babe was waiting. The field was broken
up and Hargreaves had the ball. He
ran: they all ran. He ran fastest&mdash;there
is nothing like simple language for epical
events. He got a try which was not converted
into a goal. But as no other points
were scored, Cambridge won the match by
one point to <i>nil</i>.</p>

<p>The Babe and Mr. Sykes went back to
take their tea with Reggie, and Ealing
who had been playing the Eton game,
joined them. The Babe ate three muffins
with a rapt air, and Mr. Sykes drank his
tea out of the slop-basin like a Christian.
He took cream and three lumps of sugar.
His idea of how to eat muffins was a little
sketchy, but otherwise be behaved charmingly.
But, as the Babe said, to put pieces
of half-masticated muffin on the carpet
while you drink your tea, is a thing seldom,
if ever, done in the best houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span></p>

<p>Ealing himself eschewed muffin on the
ground of its being “bad training,” and
the Babe, who held peculiar views on training,
proceeded to express them.</p>

<p>“One does every thing best,” he said,
“when one is most content. Personally
I am most content when I have eaten a
large lunch. Nobody could play Rugger
in the morning. Why? Simply because
no one is in a good temper in the morning,
except those under-vitalised people
who are never in a bad one, and who also
never play games. Of course after a very
large lunch one cannot run quite so fast,
but one is serene, and serenity has much
more to do with winning a match than
pace. Yes, another cup of tea, please.
Now Hargreaves is most content when he
has had a little bread and marmalade and
water. Every one to his taste. I hate
water except when it’s a hot bath. Water
is meant not to drink, but to heat and
wash in.”</p>

<p>“Babe, do you mean to say you have
hot baths in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Invariably when the weather is cold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span>
and a cigarette, whatever the weather is.
I am no Charles Kingsley, though I used
to collect butterflies when I was a child.”</p>

<p>“But when you became a Babe, you put
away childish things,” suggested Ealing.</p>

<p>A malignant light beamed from the
Babe’s eye.</p>

<p>“I ask you: do Babes have bull-pups?”</p>

<p>“I know one who has. I daresay he’s
an exception, though.”</p>

<p>“When I was at a private school,” remarked
the Babe severely, “and a chap
said a thing like that, we used to call him
a funny ass.”</p>

<p>Reggie shouted.</p>

<p>“Good old Babe. Has the referee
caught you yet? He belongs to this college,
and he may be in any minute. In
fact, I asked him to come to tea. I don’t
know why he hasn’t.”</p>

<p>“If you want me to go, say so,” said
the Babe.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. It was only for your
sake I suggested it. Smoke.”</p>

<p>The Babe was limping about the room
and came upon a set of chessmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span></p>

<p>“I want to play chess,” he said. “Chess
is the most delightful game if you treat it
as a game of pure chance. You ought to
move your queen into the middle of the
board and then see what happens. To reduce
it to the level of a sum in advanced
mathematics, is a scandal and an outrage.
To calculate the effect of a move takes
away all the excitement.”</p>

<p>“You may always calculate it wrong.”</p>

<p>“In that case it becomes a nuisance.
Reggie, will you play?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Ealing?”</p>

<p>“I can’t. I don’t know the moves.”</p>

<p>“Nor do I. We should be about equal.
Supposing you set two Heathen Chinese
to play chess, which would win?”</p>

<p>“Is it a riddle?”</p>

<p>The Babe sank down again in his
chair.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “If it is, I
give up. By the way what are you two
chaps doing to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Stop in bed till ten,” said Reggie, “it
being the Day of Rest: Chapel. Break<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span>fast.
Lunch. Pitt. Tea. Pitt. Sunday
Club.”</p>

<p>“Do you belong to that? I thought it
was semi-clerical.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we are all lay readers.”</p>

<p>“I went once,” said the Babe. “We
ate what is described as a cold collation.
Then we all sat round, and somebody
made jokes and we all laughed. I made
jokes too, but nobody sat round me. There
was a delightful, decorous gaiety about
the proceedings. I think we sang hymns
afterwards, or else we looked at photographs
of cathedrals, I forget which.
Hymns and photographs are so much
alike.”</p>

<p>“O Lord, what do you mean?” asked
Reggie.</p>

<p>“They are both like Sunday evening,
and things which are like the same thing
are like one another. At eleven we
parted.”</p>

<p>“The wicked old Babe doesn’t care for
simple pleasures,” said Ealing. “Oh, he
knows a thing or two.”</p>

<p>“It’s always absurd for a lot of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span>
to meet like that,” continued the Babe.
“The whole point of dining clubs ought
to be to have a lot of members with
utterly different tastes. Then you see
they can’t all talk about their tastes, they
can’t all sit round and do one thing, and
consequently they all talk rot, which is
the only rational form of conversation.
If there is one thing I detest more than
another it is cliques. Individually I love
most of the members of the Sunday Club,
collectively I cannot even like them. And
the same thing applies to the Athenæum.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you belong?”</p>

<p>“In order to go to Chapel in a pink
and white tie, and also because I love
the members individually. I must go.
Where’s Bill? Come along under my
ulster. Good-bye, you people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reggie</span> and Ealing were working together.
They had formed a work club consisting
only of themselves, and it was to meet
for the first time this morning. In order to
ensure the success of the first meeting they
had had a heavy breakfast at a quarter to
nine, because, as Reggie said, brain work is
more exhausting than anything else, after
which they had played a little snob-cricket
in the archway between the two halves of
Fellows’ Buildings, in order to clear the
brain, until their names were taken by the
porter and entered in the report book.
So they adjourned to the bridge for a
little to finish their pipes, and about a
quarter to eleven sat down one at each
side of Reggie’s larger table, with a box
of cigarettes and a tobacco jar between
them, Reggie’s alarum clock, which had
been induced to go, two copies of Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span>fessor
Jebb’s <i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i>, at which
they were both working, one small <i>Liddell
&amp; Scott</i>, and a translation of the play as
edited in Mr. Bohn’s helpful series of classical
authors, in case Professor Jebb
proved too free in his translation, “for the
difficulties,” as Reggie acutely observed,
“of rendering Greek both literally and
elegantly cannot be over-stated: indeed,
it is to be feared that some of our best
English scholars sacrifice literal rendering
to the latter.”</p>

<p>So Ealing threw a sofa cushion at his
head, and the alarum clock was knocked
over on the floor, and instantly went off.
The noise was terrific, and they had to
stifle it in a college gown, and put it in
the gyp cupboard. Then they began.</p>

<p>For ten minutes or so there was silence,
and then Ealing in an abstracted voice
asked for the <i>Liddell &amp; Scott</i>, and Reggie,
not to be behind-hand, underlined one of
Professor Jebb’s notes with a purple indelible
pencil. The point was blunt, and he
tried to make it sharper by the aid of a
dinner knife. This only resulted in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span>
gradual shortening of the pencil. Also
the point became slightly notchier.</p>

<p>Ealing, finding it impossible to go on,
while this was being done, had been
watching the proceeding at first with deep
interest, which passed into a state of wild,
unreasonable impatience.</p>

<p>“How clumsy you are,” he said at
length. “Here, pass it to me. Fancy not
being able to sharpen a pencil.”</p>

<p>There is, as every one knows, only one
individual in the world who can sharpen
pencils, and that is oneself. The same remark
applies to poking fires. So Reggie
replied airily&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind, old chap. Get on
with your work. I can do it beautifully.”</p>

<p>But the pencil got rapidly shorter, and
in order to prove to his own satisfaction
that nobody else in the world could do it,
he passed it over to Ealing with the dinner
knife. His fingers were purple, and
should have been so indelibly, but he
hopefully retired into his bedroom to see
if it could be washed off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span></p>

<p>It was clear at once to Ealing that
Reggie’s method was altogether at fault,
and he rough-hewed the pencil again so
as to be able to set to work properly.
Then the clock on the mantelpiece, which
had been set going, after the alarum became
derelict, struck eleven and Reggie
returned from his bedroom.</p>

<p>“Of course that clock is fast,” said
Ealing.</p>

<p>“It’s ten minutes slow. Why should
you think it was fast?”</p>

<p>“We must have been working longer
than I thought. We had breakfast at
half-past eight and we began working almost
immediately after, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We knocked up a bit in the
arch, you know.”</p>

<p>“Only about ten minutes. I should
say we had set to work well before ten.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we did,” said Reggie, “but I
haven’t got through much yet. How’s
the pencil getting on?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty well: but you went the
wrong way about it at first!”</p>

<p>“There won’t be much left to write<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span>
with, will there?” asked Reggie, looking
at it doubtfully.</p>

<p>“It will last you for weeks with proper
care,” said Ealing. “I think I never saw
so blunt a knife. Why haven’t you got
a proper knife?”</p>

<p>Reggie got up from the table, and
strolled across to the window, and looked
out.</p>

<p>“Be quick, old chap,” he said. “I
can’t go on till it’s ready. I’m in the
middle of underlining something.”</p>

<p>He saw an acquaintance below, and
called to him.</p>

<p>“The work club’s started this morning,”
he shouted. “We’re getting on
beautifully.”</p>

<p>(Confused sound from below, inaudible
to Ealing.)</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s just sharpening my pencil.
Isn’t it kind of him? He says he’s getting
on with it pretty well.”</p>

<p>(Murmur.)</p>

<p>“No, not very far, but I’m in the middle
of a chorus, and I’m reading Jebb’s
notes and marking them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span>”</p>

<p>(Murmur.)</p>

<p>“Oh, hours; ever since about half-past
nine or so.”</p>

<p>(Murmur.)</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>(Murmur.)</p>

<p>“Yes, Jebb’s not literal enough for me.
I like to get at the real meaning of&mdash;&mdash; Oh!”</p>

<p>The sofa cushion flew out of the window
and lay on the grass below. When
Reggie turned round Ealing was absorbed
in his book.</p>

<p>“Where’s the pencil?” asked Reggie.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any,” said Ealing.</p>

<p>“Well, I must go and pick that cushion
up. What a lot of time you’ve made me
waste. Also go to Severs’s and buy a new
pencil. I can’t work without.”</p>

<p>“This is all the thanks I get,” said
Ealing bitterly.</p>

<p>“No, I’m awfully obliged to you, but
it hasn’t done me much good, you know.
You see you acted with the best intention,
which is always fatal. Where’s my
cap?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“I should think you could borrow a
pencil,” said Ealing.</p>

<p>Reggie considered a moment, with his
head on one side.</p>

<p>“I think not. It would be better to
get one of my own. Then I shall have
one, you see. Come with me?”</p>

<p>The two went down together. As the
cushion was lying on the grass, it was
necessary to take shots in turn at Reggie’s
open window, to avoid going upstairs
again. This was much more amusing
but it took a little longer than the other
would have done, and the University
clock struck half-past eleven in a slow regretful
manner. The successful shot,
about which an even sixpence was laid,
was made by Ealing, and they crossed
King’s parade to buy a pencil. As they
got to the lodge they were further gratified
by the sight of the Babe in the road
opposite on a bicycle, which he rode
exceedingly badly and with a curious,
swoopy, wobbly motion. Mr. Sykes trotted
along at a distance of some twenty
yards off, with the air of not belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span>
to anybody, thoroughly ashamed of his
master. They called to the Babe, and
he being rash enough to try to wave his
hand to them, ran straight into the curbstone
opposite King’s gate, and dismounted
hurriedly, stepping into a large
puddle. His face was flushed with his
exertions, but, as he wrung the water out
from the bottom of his trousers, he said
genially:</p>

<p>“This is dry work, though it doesn’t
look it. A small whiskey and soda, Reggie,
would not hurt me. No doubt you
have such a thing in your room.”</p>

<p>“What about Bill Sykes?”</p>

<p>The Babe thought for a moment and
mopped his forehead, but in a few seconds
a smile of solution lighted his face.</p>

<p>“William shall be chained to the bicycle,”
he said. “Thus no one will steal
the bicycle for fear of William, and William
will not venture to run away, as he
wouldn’t be seen going about the streets
with a bicycle in tow for anything. He
despises the bicycle. I can hardly make
him follow. Come here, darling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span>”</p>

<p>But Mr. Sykes required threats and
coaxing. From the first, so the Babe
said, he was utterly opposed to the idea
of the bicycle, and had, when he thought
himself unobserved, been seen to bite it
maliciously.</p>

<p>It struck a quarter to twelve.</p>

<p>The Babe was in a peculiarly sociable
humour this morning, and after a whiskey
and soda, “a cigarette” as he remarked,
“would not be amiss,” and it was not till
he had smoked two, and been told with
brutal plainness that he was not wanted
in the least, that Reggie discovered that
he had forgotten to buy his pencil. This
necessitated his and Ealing’s making another
journey to King’s parade, and the
Babe, who bore no malice whatsoever at
being told to go away, took an arm of
each, and insisted in walking across the
grass in the hard, convincing light of
noonday.</p>

<p>It was now seven minutes past twelve,
and opposite the fountain they met the
Provost, at the sight of whom the Babe
assumed his most affable manner, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span>
they talked together very pleasantly for a
minute or two.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” as he remarked as they went
on their way, “this little meeting should
quite take the sting out of the fact that
the Porter of your colleges has just retired
into his hole in the gate, with the
object no doubt, of reporting you both
for walking across the grass. And as you
have already been reported for playing
squash, this will make twice.”</p>

<p>Bill Sykes meantime had been the object
of much attention on the part of the
casual passers-by, and he was sitting there
chattering with impotent rage, the centre
of a ring of people, in the humiliating
position of being chained to a bicycle,
which he despised and detested. At the
sight of the Babe, however, he forgot for
the moment about the bicycle, jumped
up, and tried to run towards him. Thus
it was not unnatural that the bicycle toppled
heavily over onto the top of him.
Mr. Sykes was very angry, the bell rang
loudly, and one handle of the bicycle was
bent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Sykes was released, and the Babe
who was not expert at mounting, though
he said he was the very devil when he
got going, hopped slowly down King’s
Parade for a hundred yards or so with
one foot on the step, making ineffectual
efforts to get into the saddle. There
seemed to be no reason to suppose that
he would ever succeed, but about opposite
the north end of the Chapel, he accomplished
this feat, and after describing two
or three graceful but involuntary swoops
to the right and left, secured the treadles,
and settled comfortably down into one
of the tram lines. At this moment the
tram came round the corner by St. Mary’s,
and the bicycle, with its precious burden,
seemed doomed to instant annihilation.
The Babe, however, got off just in time,
and consoled himself by swearing at the
driver, and he disappeared among the
traffic of Trinity Street still hopping.</p>

<p>“It’s like the White Knight riding,”
said Ealing. “Look sharp, Reggie, with
that beastly pencil. It’s struck a quarter
past.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Between one thing and another, it was
creditable that they were ready to begin
work again at half-past twelve. Reggie
finished underlining his note, the point
of which he could not quite understand,
and so put a query in the margin, and
Ealing went back to the word he was
looking out in <i>Liddell &amp; Scott</i>, an hour
and a quarter before.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Reggie observed
that the Babe had forgotten his cover-coat,
which was lying on a chair, and
they debated with some heat whether it
had better be taken to him at once.
Eventually they tossed up, as to who
should do it; Ealing lost the toss, and
they both jumped up with alacrity.</p>

<p>“It’s a beastly nuisance when one has
just settled down to work again,” he said.</p>

<p>“I won,” remarked Reggie, “and I am
going. By Jove, there’s that Varsity
clock striking a quarter to one. Here,
let’s both go. It’s no use working for
a quarter of an hour. One can’t do anything
in a quarter of an hour, and I must
lunch at one, as I’m playing footer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“All right. Of course we work after
tea for two hours more as we settled.
That will make five, and one more after

<p>“And six hours steady work a day,”
said Reggie cheerfully, “is as much as
is good for any man. I begin not to attend
after I have worked, really worked,
you know, for six hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Babe was no waterman, and he
never pretended to be, but this did not
prevent his getting up a quiet picnic on
the upper river one delightful afternoon
towards the end of May. There were
only to be four of them, not counting
Mr. Sykes&mdash;though it was impossible not
to count Mr. Sykes, the others being
Reggie, Ealing, and Jack Marsden.</p>

<p>Marsden, who had once, when a Freshman,
been coached on the river, by an
angry man in shorts, and had been
abandoned as hopeless after his first trial,
was naturally supposed by the Babe to
be an accomplished oarsman, and to
have probed to its depths the nature of
boats and oars and stretchers, so he was
deputed to find a boat which held four
people, several hampers, and a dog, and</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">which was warranted not to shy or bolt,
and to be quiet with children. It was
understood that the Babe was not going
to row or steer, his office being merely
to provide food for them all, and if possible
to prevent Mr. Sykes from leaping
overboard when they passed the bathing-sheds,
and biting indiscriminately at the
bathers, whom for some reason of his
own he regarded with peculiar but perfectly
ineradicable disfavour. The Babe
had taken him up the river only the
week before, but opposite the town sheds
Sykes had been unable to restrain himself,
had jumped off the boat into the
water and chased to land a bland and
timid shopkeeper, to whom the Babe
owed money, so it looked as if it was
a put-up job; the man had regained the
steps of the bathing-shed only just in
time to save himself from being pinned
in the calf of the leg.</p>

<p>The Babe and Jack were to start from
the raft by Trinity at three, and pick up
Reggie and Ealing opposite King’s. They
were then to row up to Byron’s Pool (so<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span>-called
because there is no reason to suppose
that Byron was not extremely fond
of it,) bathe and have tea, and afterwards
go a mile or so farther, and have dinner.
The Babe who just now was gated at ten,
confidently hoped to be home at or before
that hour, on the sole ground that Napoleon
had once said there was no such
word as impossible.</p>

<p>They paddled quietly up to the Mill
just above the town, and here it was
necessary to haul the boat over the bank
separating the upper river from the lower.
The Babe who was beautifully dressed in
white flannels, yellow boots, and a straw
hat with a new riband, courteously declined
giving the smallest assistance to the others,
but watched the operation with interest
and apparent approval, in consequence of
which he was advised by Reggie, who had
got hot and rather dirty with his exertions,
to drop that infernally patronising attitude.
Here too Mr. Sykes first sniffed the prey,
for he had caught sight of the bathers at
the town sheds across the fields, and was
trotting quietly off in their direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span>
secretly licking his lips, but outwardly
pretending that he was merely going for
a little airy walk on his own account.
The Babe had to run after him and haul
him back, for he affected to hear neither
whistling nor shouting, and on his return
he kept smelling suspiciously at the legs
of casual passers-by as if he rather suspected
that they were going to bathe too.</p>

<p>Though the lower river is one of the
foulest streams on the face of the earth,
the upper river is one of the fairest. It
wanders up between fresh green fields,
bordered by tall yellow flags, loosestrife,
and creamy meadow-sweet, all unconscious
of the fate that awaits it from vile man
below. Pollarded willows lean over the
bank and listen to the wind, and here
and there a company of white poplars,
the most distinguished of trees, come
trooping down to the water’s edge. The
stream itself carpeted with waving weeds
strolls along clear and green from the
reflection of the trees, troops of bleak
poise and dart in the shallows, or shelter
in the subaqueous forests, and the Babe<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span>
said he saw a trout, a statement to which
no importance whatever need be attached.
Looking back across a mile of fields you
see the pinnacles of King’s rise grey and
grave into the sky; and in front, Granchester,
with its old-fashioned garden-cradled
houses, presided over by a church
tower on the top of which, as a surveyor
once remarked, there is a plus sign which
is useful as a fixed point, nestles in a
green windless hollow.</p>

<p>But Bill, like Gallio, cared for none of
those things. He knew perfectly well
that they were going to pass the town
bathing-place very shortly, and after half
a mile or so more of uninteresting river,
the University bathing-place. The Babe
had taken him up here once when he had
bathed himself, and though Mr. Sykes
realised that he must not bite his master,
whatever foolish and ungentlemanly thing
he chose to do, he was very cold and reserved
to him afterwards. But he meant
to behave exactly as he pleased at the
town bathing-place, and a hundred yards
before they got there, he was standing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">{81}</a></span>
the bow of the boat, uttering short malignant
growls. The Babe, however, pulled
him back by the tail, and muffled him up
in four towels, and Mr. Sykes rolled about
the bottom of the boat, and from within
the towels came sounds of deep dissatisfaction
just as if there were a discontented
bull-pup in the middle of them.</p>

<p>Beyond the town bathing-place stands
a detached garden, with bright flower-beds
cut out in a lawn of short green turf.
Here the Babe conceived a violent desire
to land and have tea, which he was not
permitted to do; and above that runs a
stretch of river, very properly known as
Paradise, seeing which the Babe had a fit of
rusticity and said he would go no farther,
but live evermore under the trees with
Mr. Sykes, and grow a honey-coloured
beard. He would encamp under the open
sky, and on fine afternoons would be seen
sitting on the river bank dabbling his feet
in the water, and playing on a rustic pipe
made of reeds. He would keep a hen and a
cow and a bed of strawberries, and it should
be always a summer afternoon. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span>
had not a water-rat been seen at the moment,
which compelled him to throw Mr.
Sykes overboard to see whether he could
catch it,&mdash;which he could not&mdash;there is
no knowing what developments this rustic
phase would have undergone. So they
went slowly on, making a small detour up
to the Granchester Mill, where the water
came hurrying out cool and foamy, and
where the Babe asked an elderly man,
who was fishing intently on the bank,
whether he had had any bites, which
seemed to infuriate him strangely, for he
was fishing with a fly; drifted down again
under a big chestnut tree, all covered with
pyramids of white blossoms, and turned
up the left arm of the river. The water
was shallower here, and now and then
gravelly shoals appeared above the surface.
They frequently ran aground, and
made no less than three futile attempts to
get round a sharp corner, where the
stream running swiftly took the nose of
the boat into the bank, and the Babe swore
gently at them all, and told them to mark
the finish, and get their hands away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">{83}</a></span></p>

<p>A long lane of quiet shallow water leads
to the tail of the pool, and here the river
spreads out into a broad deep basin.
Grey sluice gates, flanked with red brick
form the head of it, and on one side
stretches out a green meadow, on the
other there rises out of an undergrowth
of hazel and hemlock, a copse of tall trees,
where the nightingales always omit to
sing. They ran the boat in at the edge
of the copse, and Reggie lighted the
spirit lamp to boil the kettle for tea, while
the Babe tied up Mr. Sykes, lest he should
forget himself at the sight of four bathers.</p>

<p>Among sensuous pleasures, bathing on
a hot day stands alone, and Byron’s
Pool is in the first flight of bathing
places. There are some who prefer
Romney Weir, and say that bathing is
nought unless you plunge into a soda
water of bubbles; some think that the
essence of bathing is a mere pickling of
the human form in brine, and are not
happy except in the sea; to others the
<i>joie de baigner</i> consists of flashing through
the air much as M. Doré has pictured<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span>
Satan falling down from Heaven. But
in Byron’s Pool the reflective, or what we
may call the garden bather is well off.
He has clean water deep to the edge, a
grassy slope shadowed by trees to dry on,
and a boat to take a header from. Even
Mr. Stevenson, a precisian in these matters,
would allow “that the imagination
takes a share in such a cleansing.” And
by the time they were dressed, the kettle
was boiling, and Fortune smiled on them.</p>

<p>The Babe refused, however, to stir
before he had drunk four cups of tea, and
in consequence the kettle had to be boiled
again.</p>

<p>“Besides,” said he, “Mr. Sykes hasn’t
had his second cup.”</p>

<p>It was generally felt that this was more
important than the Babe’s fourth cup, and
Reggie filled the kettle.</p>

<p>“The Babe’s pensive,” he said, “What
is it, Babe?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Sometimes I get pensive
on fine days or on wet evenings, but
it doesn’t usually last long. I think I
want to fall in love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Well it’s May week next week.”</p>

<p>“One is always supposed to fall in love
with each other’s sisters in May week,”
remarked the Babe with a fine disregard
of grammar. “But the sisters either die
of consumption or else the Dean snaps
them up, and so it doesn’t come off.
Besides one so seldom does what one is
supposed to do.”</p>

<p>“Not often. Byron was supposed to
bathe here for instance, and you are supposed
to be in by ten to-night, Babe.”</p>

<p>“Napoleon said&mdash;” began the Babe.</p>

<p>“Dry up. Why did they gate you?”</p>

<p>“For repeated warnings, I believe. I
never asked them to warn me. They go
and warn me,” said the Babe, getting a
little shrill, “and then they go and gate
me for it. I have been allowed no voice
whatever in the matter.”</p>

<p>“What did they warn you about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was Bill and the bicycle between
them, and the time, and the place.
Life is a sad business, and mine is a hard
lot.”</p>

<p>“You are a bad lot,” suggested Jack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span></p>

<p>“Jack, for God’s sake don’t be funny,”
said Ealing.</p>

<p>“I thought the Babe wanted a little
cheering up. I know he likes being
called a bad lot. He isn’t really.”</p>

<p>“It is quite true,” said the Babe in a
hollow voice. “I have tried to go to the
devil, and I can’t. It is the most tedious
process. Virtue and simplicity are stamped
on my face and my nature. I am like
Queen Elizabeth. I was really cut out
to be a milkmaid. I don’t want to get
drunk, or to cultivate the lower female.
The more wine I drink, the sleepier I
get; I have to pinch myself to keep
awake, and I should be sleeping like a
dead pig long before I got the least intoxicated.
Even then if you woke me
up I could say the most difficult words
like Ranjitsinghi without the least incoherence.
And as for the lower female&mdash;well,
I had to wait at the station the
other day for half an hour, so I thought
it was a good opportunity to talk to the
barmaid at the refreshment room. So I
ordered a whiskey and soda and called
her ‘Miss.’ I did indeed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“What a wicked Babe.”</p>

<p>“I did call her Miss. ‘Miss,’ I tell
you,” shouted the Babe. “Then I said
it was a beautiful day, and she said ‘Yes,
dear.’ She called me ‘dear,’ and I submitted.
I didn’t throw the whiskey and
soda at her, I didn’t call for help or give
her in charge. I determined to go
through with it. She was a mass of well-matured
charms, and she breathed heavily
through her nose. Round her neck
she had a massive silver locket on with
‘Pizgah,’ or ‘Kibroth Hataavah,’ or ‘Jehovah
Nisi’ upon it.”</p>

<p>“Decree Nisi,” suggested Ealing.</p>

<p>“She looked affectionately at me,” continued
the Babe, “and a cold shudder ran
through me. She asked me if I would
treat her to a glass of port, <i>port</i>, at a
quarter-past four in the afternoon. I said,
‘By all means,’ and she pulled a sort of
lever, the kind of thing you put a train
into a siding with, and out came port,
which she drank. Then she said smilingly,
‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Aven’t seen you for a long time,’
which was quite true, as I’d never set
foot in the place before, and she wo<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span>n’t
see me again for an equally long time.
I waited there ten minutes, ten whole
ghastly minutes, and the words froze on
my tongue, and the thoughts in my brain.
For the life of me I could not think of
another thing to say. She continued to
smile at me all the time. She smiled for
ten minutes without stopping. And so we
parted. The kettle is boiling, Reggie.”</p>

<p>The Babe mixed Mr. Sykes’s second cup
for him and drank his fourth.</p>

<p>“It is no use,” he said. “I am irredeemably
silly, and I have no other characteristic
whatever. My golden youth is
slipping from me in the meantime.”</p>

<p>Reggie shouted.</p>

<p>“The Babe thinks he is growing old.
We don’t agree with him. Of course he
is old in everything else, but not in years.
Babe, if you’re ready we’ll go on. We’ve
got to haul the boat over here.”</p>

<p>The Babe jumped up with sudden alacrity.</p>

<p>“All right. Mr. Sykes and I will get
out. We shall only be in the way. Come
on, Bill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“No, Babe,” said Jack, “you shirked before.
You shall at least carry the hampers.”</p>

<p>“I shall do nothing of the kind,” said
the Babe with dignity, and on this point
he was quite polite but perfectly firm.</p>

<p>They rowed a mile or so farther up,
and the Babe selected a suitable place for
dinner, at the edge of a hayfield and under
a willow tree, and a smile of kind indulgence
towards the world in general began
to overscore his fruitless regrets of the
afternoon. It was after eight when they
began dinner, and the Babe’s commissariat
was plentiful and elaborate. The only
dish that failed to give satisfaction was
the toasted cheese with which he insisted
they should finish dinner. It was made
in the tea kettle, and when melted, poured
out through the spout on to biscuits. Mr.
Sykes and the Babe alone attempted to
eat it, and Mr. Sykes who ate less than
the Babe was excessively unwell shortly
afterwards.</p>

<p>“But for that,” said the Babe, drinking
Chartreuse out of a tea-cup, “I blame
the lobster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span>”</p>

<p>The moon, as big as a bandbox, was
just rising clear of the trees, and the Babe
produced cigars.</p>

<p>“For mine,” he said, “is one of those
rare, generous natures that does unto
others what it would not do unto itself.
It all comes in the catechism. I will
thank any one for a simple paper cigarette.”</p>

<p>“Speech,” said Ealing. “As Stewart.”</p>

<p>The Babe bowed, and began, drawling
out his words in a low, slow, musical voice.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sykes and gentlemen,” he said,
“the May week is upon us, and we, like
the <i>Cambridge Review</i>, are at the end
of another year of University life and
thought. Some of us&mdash;most of us in fact,
have experienced for two years the widening
influence and varied duties which are
inseparable from the minds of any of
those who embark upon the harvest of
University curriculum with any earnestness
of purpose, or seriousness of aim. I
think, in fact, I am right in believing that
my friend Mr. Reginald Bristow alone&mdash;to
continue a few of my less mixed meta<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span>phors&mdash;has
put out only a year’s space
upon the sea of those special features,
which mark the career and are the hinge
of the prospects of those miners after perfectly
useless knowledge who seek to increase
their general ignorance among the
purlieus of Alma Mater. Some of us have
failed in attaining the objects of our various
ambitions, and I am happy to say that
none of us have really tried to do so. We
have none of us gone to the devil, and he
with characteristic exclusiveness has kept
aloof from us all. [Cheers] We none of us
play cricket for the University, though I
once knew a man who got his extra square
at chess; he was a dear boy, but he is
dead now, and there is not the slightest
fear that anything will prevent us from
being unable to fail in obtaining a very
respectable place in our Triposes. Yes,
the May week, which occurs in June and
lasts a fortnight, spoken of, I may say
sung of in the pages of the <i>Junior Dean</i>
and <i>The Fellow of Trinity</i>, is upon us.
Personally I detest the May week and I
am subscribing to the Grace testimonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span>
fund simply and solely because I abhor the
boat procession, but before long our stately
chapels and storied urns [cheers] will echo
to the sound of girlish laughter and maternal
feet. Gentlemen, I thank you from
the bottom of my heart for the very sincere
way in which this toast has been
received, and am happy to declare that
the Institution is now open, and the meeting
adjourned <i>sine die</i>.”</p>

<p class="cspc">. . . . . .</p>

<p>Going home, the Babe had to stand in
the bows to look out for snags and shoals.
He carried a lantern in his hand by the
light of which he scrutinised with agonised
intentness the dark surface of the water.
Just above Byron’s Pool the boat ran into
a sunken tree trunk and the Babe and his
lantern plunged heavily into the water.
So he dressed himself in the tablecloth,
and his appearance was inimitable. He
did not stop in Cambridge for the May
week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span></p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Babe spent June and the first half
of July in London. He painted his bicycle
white with Mr. Aspinall’s best enamel,
and presented a very elegant appearance
on it every morning in Battersea Park.
The elections were on, and his father, who
represented the Conservative interests of
a manufacturing town in the North of
England, was absent from London, in the
hopes of representing them again. But
party questions did not interest his son,
and the Babe, reflecting that whether the
Liberals or Conservatives governed the
country, Battersea Park would still be
open to him and his bicycle, pursued his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span>
calm course on a moderately evenly-balanced
wheel.</p>

<p>So the Babe had a commodious house
in Prince’s Gate at his disposal. For he
was the only child, and his mother, who
was a keener politician even than his
father, accompanied the latter on his political
errands. It occurred to him that
he might turn an honest penny by letting
the whole of the first floor for a week or
two after the manner of Mr. Somerset,
when he found himself in possession of
the Superfluous Mansion, but after some
consideration, he dismissed this as an unworthy
and inconvenient economy, and
telegraphed to Reggie to leave Cambridge
and the May week to take care of themselves
and join him. Reggie had kept
his term, so he obeyed, taking with him
several classical books, for the Babe, so
he said in his telegram, meant to “sap.”</p>

<p>The Babe’s “sapping” was conducted
on highly original principles. He got up
at eight, “in order,” he said, “to get a
long morning,” had a cup of tea, and then
took his bicycle with him in his mothe<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span>r’s
victoria to Battersea Park, where he rode
till ten, and then had breakfast. He got
back to Prince’s Gate about eleven in the
victoria which waited for him at the Park,
had a bath and dressed, and usually went
off to Lord’s where he watched cricket
till lunch time from the top of the pavilion,
and if the match was interesting
stopped on till about five. He then went
to the Bath Club where he bathed and
had tea, returning home in time to dress
for dinner, which he usually took at a
friend’s house. The evening was spent
at a theatre or a music hall, and he
finished up if possible at a dance. If
he had no dance to go to, he read the
evening paper at a club, and went to
bed.</p>

<p>“In fact,” as he explained to Reggie,
who arrived one evening about seven,
“we shall lead a simple and strenuous
life even in the midst of this modern
Babylon. The bicycle and the Bath Club
will minister to the needs of the body,
and our minds will minister to each other.
We take our dinner to-night at home, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span>
after dinner it would be rash not to see
Miss Cecilia Loftus. She can dance like
fun. I hope you have brought some
books, for otherwise you will have nothing
to do when I am working. It’s time
to dress. I see my father made four
speeches yesterday. His energy is perfectly
amazing. We will send for the
evening paper, for there are things of
overwhelming interest in it, I am told,
apart from politics.”</p>

<p>The programme at the “Pavilion”
waned in interest after the performance
of Miss Cecilia Loftus, and about eleven
the Babe proposed an adjournment. It
was a warm clear night, and they started
back, walking along Piccadilly instead of
taking a hansom. The streets were full,
and characteristically “London,” in other
words they were crowded with all sorts
and conditions of men and women, who
eyed one another with suspicious reserve.
In Paris the birds of night look at each
other with friendly interest, in London
with mistrust and enmity.</p>

<p>The Babe was in an expansive mood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span>
and like Byron, he bitterly lamented his
own loneliness in the crowd.</p>

<p>“Here am I,” he said, “a young man
of pleasing manner, and amiable disposition,
and I feel like a solitary wayfarer in
the desert of Sahara. When the four
men in the <i>New Arabian Nights</i> left
Prince Florizel’s smoking divan, and
plunged into the roaring streets, they
were engulfed by strange adventures before
they had gone a hundred yards.
The Lady of the Superfluous Mansion
annexed one, the Fair Cuban another,
the man with the chin beard a third.
What could be more delightful? And
yet I might walk the streets till the crack
of doom, and the archangels would have
to send me home at the last, still adventureless.”</p>

<p>“Poor Babe,” said Reggie, “but perhaps
every one else is in the same plight;
perhaps they are all longing for you to
speak to them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said the Babe, “they
seem to me supremely indifferent as to
whether I speak to them or not. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span>
are we to do, Reggie? The night is
yet young, but we are growing old. I
think a little supper, four or five dozen
native lobsters, as Mrs. Nickleby suggested,
would not hurt us. I hear that
there is a most commodious restaurant at
the Savoy Hotel. It would be well to be
certain on that point. We are walking
in the wrong direction but we will do so
no longer. Let us take a hansom. Nothing
will happen to us. But we will give
this wicked world one more chance. We
will walk back across Leicester Square.
It is supposed to be the fountain-head of
all adventures, and the home of all adventurers.
We will loiter there a few moments.”</p>

<p>“What sort of adventures do you want,
Babe?” asked Reggie.</p>

<p>“Why that’s exactly what I couldn’t
tell you,” said the Babe, “the point of an
adventure is that it is absolutely unexpected.
If I could tell you what I wanted,
it would cease to be unexpected, and
therefore cease to be an adventure. If
you know what you are going to do, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span>
no adventure. But it’s no use: unexpected
things never happen. We will
take a cab and eat oysters. Perhaps the
oysters will be stale, and if so, it will be a
kind of adventure, for they are invariably
fresh at the Savoy.”</p>

<p>The Babe selected a table in the balcony
opening out of the restaurant; below
they could see the long gaslit line of embankment
curving gently towards Westminster,
and the river flowing turbidly
out with the ebbing tide. In the middle
distance the bridge of Charing Cross with
one great electric lamp high in the air,
crossed to the Surrey side, and every now
and then a train shrieked across under
the glass arch of the station. In the
street below there jingled by, from time
to time, a hansom, noiseless except for
the bell, and the sharp-cut ring of the
horse’s hoofs. A party of shrill-voiced
Americans took a table near them, and
discussed the relative merits of English
and American cars, with passionate partisanship.
There were of course no oysters
to be had, as it was June, and native<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span>
devilled kidneys had to take their place.
Tired-looking waiters flitted noiselessly
about, and the Babe’s face caught from
the kidneys a livelier animation.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” he said, “we will go
even unto the Oval, and watch the gentlemen
and players. It is strange that to
play cricket is the most doleful of human
pursuits, and to watch it one of the most
delightful. When I grow up I shall keep
twenty-two men who shall play cricket
before me, as Salome danced before
Herod. They shall play a perpetual match,
which shall never come to a world without
end. Amen. Have some more kidneys,
Reggie? A few of our small kidneys
would not hurt you. Waiter, bring some
more kidneys. Kidneys are not attractive
to the eye, but the proof of them is in the
eating. I eat them because they are so
comfortable, as the Psalmist says. By
the way, has Sir John Lubbock put the
eating of kidneys among his <i>Pleasures of
Life</i>? I shall write a book called <i>The
Sorrows of Death</i> as a companion volume.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Do; and have it set to music by Mendelssohn.”</p>

<p>“Mendelssohn is dead, and the kidneys
are dead,” said the profane Babe. “Hullo
there’s Stewart. He looks like a man out
of the <i>Yellow Book</i> by Aubrey Beardsley.
I wish I could look as if Aubrey Beardsley
had drawn me; shall I ask him to supper,
Reggie? I wonder what he’s doing at
the Savoy?”</p>

<p>But Mr. Stewart had got a Cabinet
Minister in hand just for the present, and
it was half an hour or so before he joined
them; even then it took him ten minutes
to get through the amiability of Cabinet
Ministers, before descending to more sublunary
topics. But when he descended,
as the Babe said afterwards, he came down
with a run, and talked about music-halls
and other things.</p>

<p>He was most sympathetic with the
Babe’s misfortune in being unable to stop
up for May week, and inveighed against
the government and management of the
University generally.</p>

<p>“It is incredible to me,” he said, “per<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span>fectly
incredible that so much pedantry
and narrowness can be compressed into so
small a place. There is not a single one
of my colleagues whom I could call a man
of the world. I was saying just now to
my dear friend Abbotsbury who has been
very strongly urging me to stand for Cambridge
in Parliament, that I am really
quite unfit, perfectly unfit to represent the
University. I know nothing whatever
about my colleagues, and I disapprove of
all I know of them. Take your own case.
You are of years of discretion, my dear
Babe, and if you choose to dress in a tablecloth,
no one has any right to prevent you.
They wouldn’t have any right to stop you
if you chose to dress in two&mdash;less right in
fact. I’m sure you looked charming in a
tablecloth. Why should the Dean of
your college exercise jurisdiction over
your dress? He is no Prince Regent.
For he dresses himself in a cake hat and
a tail coat, which is perhaps the least becoming
style of dress which can be conceived.
Yet he isn’t sent down for it.
Why should he be allowed to make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span>
Great Court of Trinity hideous, and you
be sent down for&mdash;for making it beautiful?”</p>

<p>“The Babe did a skirt dance down
Malcolm Street,” remarked Reggie, “and
it was a windy night.”</p>

<p>“Well, the Babe isn’t to blame if it is
a windy night,” said Mr. Stewart. “They
had probably been praying for wind in
St. Mary’s, though the only time in my
life that I attended a University sermon
there was plenty of wind. The sermon
was preached by a black missionary, who
I think said he came from Iceland, which
I don’t believe. He literally swept us
away in a hurricane of inconsequent appeal.
Really to assume that the Babe is
responsible for the wind, is almost profanity.
What a delicious night! It quite
makes me think of the feasts of Tiberius
at Capri. The air is as soft as the air of
Naples and all the waiters here, as at
Capri, are made in Germany. Germany
itself, I believe, is getting gradually depopulated,
and I ‘m sure I don’t wonder.
Yes, I am staying here for a day or two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span>
There is an expensive simplicity about the
Savoy, which almost lets me forget for
the time the pompous cheapness both
literal and literary of University towns.
Oxford is no better. Dons think about
croquet and Triposes at Cambridge, and
about Moderations and lawn tennis at
Oxford. It is six of one and five and a
half of the other. And the <i>cuisine</i> of
the college kitchens is enough to make
Savarin turn in his grave. You order
melted butter, and they bring forth milk
in a crockery dish.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were devoted to Cambridge,”
said Reggie. “I’m sure I’ve
heard you say so.”</p>

<p>“Dear Reggie, let me ask you never to
remember anything I say. But it is true
that I am devoted to what I consider to
be the <i>raison d’être</i> of Cambridge, that
is the undergraduates, with their fresh
bright lives, and their <i>insouciance</i>, their
costumes of tablecloths and their frank
contempt for the class to which I have
the misfortune to belong. That is why I
always go up in the Long, dons for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span>
time are in eclipse: it is like a whole
holiday. I am going there next week, to
stop for a month or so. I hope you are
both coming.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Babe, “we are both
going up to work. I am to go in for a
tripos in history instead of a pass. I had
a short and painful interview with my
father about it. Why are fathers so curt?
Do you suppose I shall get through?”</p>

<p>“A tripos,” remarked Mr. Stewart, “is
a form of self-mutilation. To go in for a
tripos, if you are not by nature tripical,
if I may coin a word, and I may tell you
that it is to your credit that you are not,
my dear Babe, implies a sacrifice of other
branches of your nature. Why cannot
fathers be content to let their sons be,
and not do? No one yet has ever been
able to tell me of any good thing that
comes out of triposes, except that it
keeps the Examiners to their rooms for
three weeks afterwards. But they come
out like pigmies refreshed with small beer,
and talk about quadratic calculus and deliberative
genitives with redoubled vigour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span>
The test which triposes apply discovers
whether the candidates are possessed of
a little knowledge, and so are dangerous
things. If they helped them to realise
the beauty of ancient Athens, or the picturesqueness
of the French Revolution, it
would be a different matter and I, as I
understood Longridge to do the other
day at a College meeting, should advocate
having a tripos once a week and twice on
Sundays. But all they do is to instil into
the minds of the undergraduates a confused
and it may be an incorrect idea,
that all Athenians were as great a bore as
Thucydides and spoke as bad Greek, and
that there is a grave doubt whether, after
all, Marie Antoinette died by the guillotine,
and was not carried off by an attack
of acute old age at the age of eighty-seven.
Even if it was so, and it is far
from certain, why tell any one about it?
History rightly considered is a great and
wonderful romance, and the methods employed
at places of education is to render
sterile all the germs of romance it contains,
and condense the residue of facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span>
into the smallest possible compass, and
Mr. Stanley Weyman then proceeds to
write reliable blue books about them,
which his publisher libellously advertises
as “New Novels,” though they are neither
new nor novel. One of my colleagues
just before the tripos, circulated among
his pupils a half-sheet of paper, not very
closely printed. But that infernal half-sheet
contained all the procedure of the
Athenian law courts, and if learned by
heart, quite unintelligently, as he recommended,
would insure full marks on any
question that might be set on the subject.
I had the misfortune to be with him when
one of his pupils returned from the examination,
and he literally danced for joy all
over the Combination Room, though he
is a stout man, when he saw that three
questions out of nine could be completely
answered from his repulsive little half-sheet.
And the tripos in the face of
these revolting details, is called a test of
a man’s ability, and goes a long way to
win him a Fellowship. You, my dear
Babe, are a man of far more liberal edu<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span>cation
than that lamentable colleague of
mine, though, I may say, in answer to
your question, that I would only take
very long odds if I had to bet on your
chance of getting through.”</p>

<p>“I got through my last May’s,” remarked
the Babe in self-defence.</p>

<p>“Yes, but without incriminating myself,
my dear boy, I must remind you that
I looked over at least three of your papers,
and the marks I gave you were
more for your capability of acquiring romantic
and delightful knowledge, and for
a certain power of giving plausible and
voluminous answers to questions of which
it was obvious you knew nothing whatever,
than the actual knowledge your papers
displayed. However if you come
down to little half-sheets of useless and
absurd facts, no doubt you will be able to
get through, and it is upon that, that I
would take only very long odds. From
what I know of you, I do not think you
will come down to that. I am delighted
to hear you are coming up in the Long,
and we will read some charming French<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span>
memoirs together. They are much more
amusing, and much more picturesque than
Zola’s tedious pictures of the Second Empire.
Reggie, you are classical, are you
not? Read, mark, and learn the <i>Phædrus</i>,
and the <i>Symposium</i>. The former you
should read on the upper river under a
plane tree if possible, the latter after
dining wisely and well in your rooms, and
you will know more of the essential Greek
than all Mackintyre’s horrid little half-sheets
could ever teach you.”</p>

<p>“Then do you think the tripos is perfectly
useless and valueless?” asked the
Babe.</p>

<p>“Absolutely so: and what makes it
more ridiculous is that it is not even ornamental.
Most useless things have some
beauty or charm about them. The tripos
alone, as far as I know, has none. I have
only done one thing in my life of which I
am thoroughly ashamed, and that is that
I took a first in my tripos. Mackintyre
of course did the same. It is the thing in
his life&mdash;he was Senior Classic I think&mdash;of
which he is most proud. However, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span>
do him justice, I believe that of late years
what is called the Philatelic Society has
usurped most of his leisure time. No, it
has nothing to do with telepathy; it
means loving things that are a long way
off and is specialised to apply to collections
of postage stamps. To me the word
denotes ‘Distance lends enchantment to
the view.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>The Babe was continuing to eat strawberries
with a pensive air while Mr. Stewart
spoke, and having finished the dish he
looked round plaintively, and Reggie
caught his eye.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t eat any more, Babe,” he
said, “it’s after twelve, and we’re going
out at eight to-morrow, and we have to
get back to Prince’s Gate.”</p>

<p>The Babe sighed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sykes will be waiting up for us,”
he said; “I suppose we ought to go. He
will lose his beauty-sleep.”</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> the Babe took Reggie’s queen, which
for the last eight moves had led a dog’s
life, and Reggie lost his temper and upset
the board intentionally. Mr. Sykes
who was lying on the hearth-rug, pretended
that the black king was a rat, though of
course he knew it was not, and proceeded
to worry it.</p>

<p>In other words it was just after lunch
on Monday the 7th of August. They
had lunched in Hall, and a Fellow of the
college, who rejoiced in the name of Gingham
had asked them to play croquet afterwards
in the King’s garden at half-past
two. There was no cricket going on, and
it was too hot to play tennis, so they very
kindly consented.</p>

<p>The black king was rescued, and the
Babe tucked Mr. Sykes under his arm and
shut him into Reggie’s gyp closet, as the
sight of a croquet ball always inspired him
with a wild, chattering rage, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span>
strolled out onto the bridge to wait for
Gingham, who appeared before long accompanied
by a colleague from another
college, of mean appearance, who proved
also to be of uncertain temper.</p>

<p>The limes down to the back gate were
in full flower and resonant with bees, and
Mr. Gingham made a very felicitous quotation
from the fourth Georgic with gay
facility. Beyond, the road along the Backs
lay cool and white beneath the enormous
elms, and the Babe asserted that he heard
a nightingale, which Mr. Gingham’s friend
said was quite impossible, since it was the
end of the first week in August. But the
Babe remarked with a fatuous smile, that
he had been Senior Ornithologist, and
might be supposed to know. Upon which
Mr. Gingham’s friend said there was no
such thing as an Ornithological tripos, and
the Babe replied: “That’s a Loring,” and
refused to explain further.</p>

<p>Behind the railings the garden lay
deliciously fresh and green. Long, level
plains of grass were spread about between
the flower-beds, and the whole place had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span>
an air of academic and cultivated repose.
On one of these stretches of lawn a game
of tennis was in progress; the performance
was not of a very high class, but the players
seemed to be enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>Each game opened with a regularity
which to the ordinary mind would appear
monotonous in incessant repetition. The
first service delivered by all the players
was a swift, splendid fault served low into
the net, and this was invariably followed
by a slow underhand service, always
perfectly faultless, but probably easy of
execution. Then, however, a pleasing
diversity varied the progress of the rest.
About sixty per cent. of these services
were returned, in which case the partner of
the server, who stood close up to the net,
hit them cruelly out of court and called
the score in an angry, rasping voice, as if
it had been contradicted. The other forty
per cent. came to an untimely end in the
meshes of the net. But the interest of
the game to the Babe, who lagged behind
to watch it for a few minutes, was, that
whereas most people who play lawn-tennis<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span>
indifferently are exactly like everybody
else, these four players seemed to him to
be like nobody else. One of them was
so glaringly obscure that you would
scarcely have known he was there, if you
had not seen him returning the balls; the
second was more neglected by nature than
one would have thought a living man
could be, and had the sleeves of his shirt
buttoned round his wrists; the third had a
face which resembled only the face of an
emaciated man seen in the bowl of a
spoon, and the features of the fourth
were obscured by a hat which resembled
a beehive in shape, and a frieze coat in
texture, but on the doctrine of probabilities,
it seemed likely that, did we know all,
he would have proved to be as remarkable
as his fellow sportsmen. He whisked
about with astonishing rapidity, though he
was hardly ever in his right place, and a
handkerchief which dangled out of his
trousers pocket reminded the observer of
a white, badly-trimmed tail.</p>

<p>The Babe’s curiosity to see his face
grew unbearable, but, like the Quangle-<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span>Wangle,
his face was not to be seen.
Once the Babe thought he caught sight
of a small, round, open mouth, but he
could not be sure.</p>

<p>The name of Mr. Gingham’s colleague
was Jones, and he and Gingham played
the Babe and Reggie. Jones began, but
failed at the second hoop, and the Babe
having passed it, croquetted him cheerfully
away into a fine big bush about one
hundred yards distant. He said to Jones,
in his genial way: “An enemy hath done
this,” but got no reply. He then tried to
get into position for the third hoop, and
it is doubtful whether in all the annals of
croquet, there was ever made so vilely
futile a stroke. Gingham followed, and as
it was hopeless to mobilise with a ball a
hundred yards off, took a shot at the
Babe’s ball, got through the third hoop,
and secured position for the cage. Reggie
mobilised with the Babe, and then there
was a pause, broken by a confused but
angry murmur from inside a beautiful laurestinus
now in full flower. It is almost
needless to explain that Jones could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span>
find his ball. When he did discover it, he
took it out and made an extraordinarily
good attempt to get into position for the
second hoop, but just hit the wire, and lay
in a bee-line with the opening. He lit a
cigarette and tried to kick the match with
which he had lit it.</p>

<p>Then it was that Satan entered into
the Babe’s soul, and from this point an
analysis of Jones’s strokes is worth recording.</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Jones gave vent to a
most regrettable remark about the Babe,
and his nose swelled a little. Such a result
was excusable, for the Babe’s diabolical
ingenuity in attacking him had
only been equalled by his diabolical luck.
Twice,&mdash;for the ground was not well-rolled&mdash;had
his ball come skipping and
hopping along, and had pounced upon
his adversary’s like a playful kitten, and
twice he had cannoned violently off a
hoop onto it. But about this point his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span>
luck had shown signs of failing, and he
sheltered himself for a few strokes near
his partner, who together with Gingham
had been plodding slowly and steadily
round the hoops. Altogether the
game had been like “Air with Variations,”
the Babe and Mr. Jones taking brilliant
firework excursions across the theme. But
for a little while it seemed as if the cup
of the Babe’s iniquities was full, and for
ten minutes he kept falling into the hand
of his adversaries with the most surprising
persistence. But the end was
not yet.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the position was as
follows:</p>

<p>Reggie and Gingham were rovers, the
Babe had not been through the cage coming
back, but Jones had only the two last
hoops to pass, and it was Jones’s turn.
The Babe was getting a little excited, and
the lust for vengeance was on Jones. He
had even gone so far as to advise the
Babe what to do on one occasion, and the
Babe had answered him shortly in a high,
tremulous voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span></p>

<p>The Babe’s ball was in position for the
cage, and theoretically Jones was wired
to him. But his ball, violently and maliciously
struck, curled in a complicated
manner off the cage wires and hit the
Babe’s.</p>

<p>“That’s a beastly fluke,” said that gentleman
in an excited contralto.</p>

<p>Jones could afford to be generous.</p>

<p>“It did turn it off a little,” he said pacifically,
“but I think it would have hit it
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Then you think wrong,” said the Babe
outwardly calm.</p>

<p>The laurestinus quivered.</p>

<p>Jones became a rover, and mobilised
with his partner, but not very close.</p>

<p>The Babe failed to mobilise with
Reggie.</p>

<p>Gingham shot at his partner and
missed.</p>

<p>Reggie mobilised successfully with the
Babe.</p>

<p><i>Quem deus vult perdere, prius dementat.</i>
Jones ought to have separated them
but having hit his partner, he tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span>
put him out, failed, but left himself and
his partner both close to the stump.</p>

<p>The Babe smiled, and there was a tea-party
of four. He smiled again a little
unkindly. He put Gingham out, and he
hit Jones’s ball. A moment afterwards a
frenzied croquet ball bounded into the
net of the tennis-players, and caused the
spoon-faced man, for the first time that
afternoon, to serve two consecutive faults.
Then the Babe went back to his hoop.
Gingham was of a peaceful disposition
but rather timid. He had, however,
caught a glimpse of Jones’s face as he
walked off to the lawn-tennis court, and it
might reasonably, he said afterwards, have
frightened a bolder man than he. So he
turned to the Babe.</p>

<p>“You know it’s only a game,” he said,
and the Babe replied still rather shrilly:</p>

<p>“Then watch me play it.”</p>

<p>Reggie and the Babe between them
could easily keep Mr. Jones’s ball safely
off the ground, and the Babe plodded
on till he too was a rover, and Reggie
and he went out in the next two turns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121">{121}</a></span></p>

<p>“A very pleasant game,” said he smiling.</p>

<p>Jones was ill-advised enough to murmur:</p>

<p>“Insolent young ass.”</p>

<p>The Babe heard and his face turned
pink, but his smile suffered no diminution.</p>

<p>“A very pleasant game,” he repeated,
“but only a game.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span>”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Babe was leaning out of the window
of the rooms he had moved into for
the Long, which looked onto the Great
Court of Trinity, and in his hands was a
simple sheet of foolscap paper rolled up
big at one end and small at the other.
He applied his mouth intermittently to
the small end of this really elementary
contrivance, and, in his hands, like the
sonnet in the hand of Milton, “the thing
became a trumpet.” Unlike Milton, however,
he was in no way liable to censure
for not using it often enough.</p>

<p>He had been working for nearly two
hours that morning, and it was only just
half-past eleven. He had got up at eight,
breakfasted, and had really been at it ever
since. As a rule, criticisms on himself did
not make the least impression on him, but
somehow or other Mr. Stewart’s unwillingness
to take any but the longest odds
on the subject of his getting through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span>
tripos had struck root and grown up rankling
in his mind. He knew quite well that
he had as much ability as many undergraduates
who tackle that examination
successfully, and he believed that if he
chose he could acquire a sufficient portion
of their industry. Hence the early rising,
the history books scattered on the table,
and indirectly the inter-mezzo on the foolscap
thing.</p>

<p>However, at twelve he was going to his
history coach for an hour, and he allowed
himself twenty minutes’ relaxation before
this. He had watched the porter take his
name for making a row in court, so, as the
worst he could do was done, there was obviously
no reason why he should discontinue
making a row, and it was not till the
mouthpiece had got sodden and the sides
stuck together that he stopped.</p>

<p>The history coach, the Babe confessed,
was rather a trial. He lived in dusty,
fusty rooms, and he himself was by far
the dustiest, fustiest thing in them. During
the first lesson the Babe had had with
him, he had employed his hands in clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span>ing
his nails with a button-hook, which
was, however, better than that he should
not clean them at all. On another occasion
a spider had dropped down from the
ceiling onto the top of his head, and had
walked down his nose, and from there
had let itself down onto the note-book
which he was using. He was short-sighted,
and finishing the lesson at that
moment and being entirely unconscious
of the spider, had shut it up with a bang
in the note-book, and the spider was a
fleshy spider. The Babe had tried to get
Mr. Stewart to coach him, but that gentleman’s
time was too deeply engaged
already. His own work, he said, “like
topmost Gargarus,” took the morning, and
he imagined that neither he nor the Babe
would care to meet over history, however
romantically treated, in the afternoon,
while social calls rendered the evening
equally impossible for both of them.</p>

<p>So the Babe went three times a week
to Mr. Swotcham of the spider. He was
a young don, but the habits of incessant
study had early bent his back, bleared his
eyes, and given him a weak, nervous man<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">{125}</a></span>ner.
He rarely took any exercise, and
even when he did he only walked a little
way along the Trumpington Road. Out
of his rooms he was like a sheep that had
gone astray, and coasted down the streets,
keeping close to the houses, as if afraid
that, should he launch himself into mid-pavement,
he would lose himself irretrievably.
He was a member of an occult,
some said obscure, club called the Apostles,
the members of which met in each
other’s rooms in a shame-faced manner
every Saturday night, though there was
really nothing in the least shameful about
their proceedings. In theory it was supposed
that they set the world straight
once a week, but no doubt they lacked
practical ability. The Babe, whose varied
acquaintance included several members
of this Society, used to ask them to dinner
on Saturday night, in order to have
the pleasure of hearing them excuse themselves
at a quarter to ten. The excuse
offered was always the same.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’ve got to go round and
see a man.”</p>

<p>The Babe followed this up by asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span>
who the man was, to which the invariable
reply was: “Oh, only a man I know.”
Then the brutal Babe throwing the mask
aside would say: “Oh, you’re going to
a meeting of the Apostles, aren’t you?”
Somehow the members seemed rather
ashamed of this fact being thus ruthlessly
dragged into light, and the Babe in his
May week paper had informed the world
that the Apostles were the spiritual descendants
of the old Hell-Fire Club of
Medmenham Abbey, and that their deeds
grew darker and darker every year. For
the most part they were radical Agnostics,
and they disestablished the English
Church about once a month. They
affected red ties, to show that they disapproved
of everything.</p>

<p>Swotcham was not only an eminent
Apostle, a sort of Peter among them, but
an eminent historian, and the Babe had
the sense to attend to what he said. It
is true that this morning he watched with
overpowering interest the turning over
of the leaves of Swotcham’s note-book,
until the corpse of the fleshy spider was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span>
discovered, blotching and staining the
articles of the Magna Charta, but when
Swotcham had scratched it off with a
J nib, his attention wandered no more.</p>

<p>It was a hopelessly wet and sloppy
afternoon, the sort of afternoon when
everything looks at its worst, and Cambridge
worst of all. Grey sheets of rain
drifted and drizzled over the Great Court,
driven fretfully against the window panes
by a cold easterly wind which struck the
spray of the fountain beyond the basin
out sideways onto the path. Outside the
gate, the lime trees wept sooty tears and
leaves early-dead, and the asphalt of
Trinity Street looked like the surface
of some stagnant dirty river, distortedly
reflecting the dull-faced houses on each
side. A melancholy gurgle of water
streamed into the grating in the centre
of the so-called Whewell’s Court, and its
more classical name seemed to be divinely
apt. The air was close, cold, and infinitely
damp, and two or three terriers inhumanely
left outside the Pitt, appeared like a realistic
rendering of discomfort personified.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128">{128}</a></span></p>

<p>So the judicious Babe betook himself
to the smoking room of that club, which
always maintains a uniformity of gloom
and comfort, whatever the weather is, and
thought to himself as he settled in a big
armchair that until he left, the weather
could have no further depressing influence.
He took out of the library the inimitable
<i>Ravenshoe</i> which he already knew nearly
by heart, and read with undiminished
enjoyment of how Napoleon and a colonial
Bishop whose real name was Jones, gave
testimonials to a corn-cutter, who had them
printed in his advertisement, and of how
Gus and Flora were naughty in church.
Later on, he proposed to have hot toast
with his tea.</p>

<p>He had not been there long when Reggie
came in, and as the Babe was not
disposed to talk, and merely grunted
when he was sat on, he got out a new
book called <i>Gerald Eversley’s Friendship</i>,
and proceeded to read about the peculiarities
which mark the boys at St. Anselm’s.</p>

<p>A short silence.</p>

<p>“Goozlemy, goozlemy, goozlemy,”
quoted the Babe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129">{129}</a></span></p>

<p>“Look here, Babe.”</p>

<p>“Well.”</p>

<p>“Harry Venniker produces from the
bottom of his box a quantity of sporting
prints, and an enormous stag’s head&mdash;a
‘royal’ he called it. Did you ever see
a play-box that size?”</p>

<p>“No. There isn’t one. ‘My dear,
there is going to be a collection, and I
have left my purse on the piano.’ I wish
I knew Flora.”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>After all, in this life the deepest,
holiest feelings are inexpressible.’ Oh, I
draw the line somewhere&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you don’t draw the line somewhere,”
murmured the Babe, “where are
you to draw the line?”</p>

<p>“Gerald of course sobs violently on
getting into bed, the first night at St.
Anselm’s, and Harry puts his hand on his
shoulder, and says he’ll be his friend for
ever. Then ‘Gerald laid his head anew
upon the pillow, and was at peace.’ Good
Lord! This was an ‘incident of which
the pale moon, throned in heaven, was the
sole arbitress.’ He says so,” shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">{130}</a></span>
Reggie, “and it is a ‘study in real life.’
He says that too, on the title-page, in
capital letters. He says it very loud and
plain, several times.”</p>

<p>The Babe chuckled comfortably, and
shut up <i>Ravenshoe</i>.</p>

<p>“I read it yesterday,” he said. “Turn
on to about page 90 or so. I think you’ll
find the passage marked in pencil. He
has to sing a song in which a swear-word
comes, and when he gets to it, he breaks
down, hides his face in his hands, and
rushes from the hall.”</p>

<p>Reggie’s eyes grew rounder and rounder.</p>

<p>“So they propose to send him to Coventry
for a month.”</p>

<p>“That’s the place my governor is
member for,” remarked the Babe, “and
they make bicycles there.”</p>

<p>“The little brute&mdash;aged thirteen, Babe,
about as old as you,” continued Reggie,
“reads books of science (particularly
archæology), even sermons and books of
controversial divinity, in the college library.
If that is real life, give me fiction.”</p>

<p>“Quite a little Zola,” said the Babe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span>
“our new, harmless, English realist. A
little later on a churchyard becomes an
element in Gerald’s life. Are churchyards
elements in your life, Reggie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p>“Later on again,” continued the Babe,
“he gets in a row for cribbing. The
author gets hold of such wonderfully new
and original situations. The evidence
against him is overwhelming, absolutely
overwhelming, and the mystery is never
cleared up. As you read, your suspense
is only equalled by the suspense of the
author. He finds it almost unbearable.”</p>

<p>“I can’t read any more,” said Reggie.
“Tell me what happens.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all the regular things. Harry gets
into the eleven, and Gerald Eversley turns
into Robert Elsmere for a time. Then
of course he falls in love with Harry’s
sister, who gallops away in consumption,
and dies. So Gerald determines to commit
suicide, and leaves a note for Harry
saying what he is going to do, and just as
he is preparing to jump into a lake&mdash;he
has previously thrown his coat with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span>
stone wrapped up in it, into the water&mdash;he
feels a hand on his shoulder. It’s Harry
of course. Naturally he has found the
letter, which tells him that the writer will
be a corpse when he finds it, which is
a black lie, and goes off just in time to
the place where Gerald very prudently
tells him that the deed will be done. So
Gerald goes to a town in the North of
England, probably Coventry again, and
wears a locket of purest enamel, with the
name ‘Ethel’ on it. The book ends: ‘He
is dead now.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>Reggie was still turning over the leaves
of the book.</p>

<p>“Who is Mr. Selby?”</p>

<p>“The good young master with a secret
sorrow, to whom all the boys open their
hearts.”</p>

<p>“I see that Harry lies at death’s door,
having caught inflammation of the lungs in
a football match. That’s another original
situation.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, yes, and old gentlemen cannot
meet fifty years after they have left
school without saying: ‘You remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span>
that catch? My dear fellow, why did you
let that ball go through your legs?’ I
would sooner be Babe all my life than
live to be an old man like that.”</p>

<p>“And Harry gets the last goal just before
time. The back’s leg ‘flashed.’ I’ve
never seen your legs flash, Babe.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I’m only a half-back.”</p>

<p>“That accounts for it. Let’s have tea,
and then we’ll play a game of pills.”</p>

<p>“All right. Then you can dine in Hall
with me. I can’t afford dinner in my
room, and we’ll work afterwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Stewart</span>, as has been indicated
before, had a weakness, and that was an
amiable and harmless one. His weakness
was for the aristocracy. Compared with
this, his feeling for royalty which was of
the same order, but vastly intensified,
might also be called a total failure of
power, a sort of mental general paralysis.
So when one day towards the middle of
August, the wife of the Heir Apparent
of a certain European country caused a
telegram to be sent to him, to the effect
that her Royal Highness wished to visit
Cambridge before leaving the country,
and would be graciously pleased to take
her luncheon with him, Mr. Stewart was
naturally a proud man. He bought a long
strip of brilliant red carpet, he ordered a
lunch from the kitchen that set the mouth
of the cook watering, “and altogether,” as
the Babe very profanely and improperly
said, “made as much fuss as if the Virgin<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span>
Mary had been expected.” He also sent
printed cards, “to have the honour of,”
to the Vice-chancellor, the heads of four
colleges and their wives, and also to another
Fellow of his college, who only a
term before, had entertained at tea a regular
royal queen, and had asked him to
meet her. And remembering that he had
once met the Prince of Wales at a dance
in London given by the Babe’s mother,
he also asked the Babe. At the last moment,
however, the Princess sent a telegram
saying that she was going to bring
her husband with her, which would mean
two more places, one for him, and one for
his gentleman-in-waiting, and Mr. Stewart,
whose table would not hold any more than
fifteen conveniently, sent a hurried message
and apology to the Babe, saying that
all this was very upsetting, and unexpected,
and uncomfortable, and inconvenient, but
that he was sure the Babe would see his
difficulty. He would, however, be delighted
and charmed if the Babe would
come in afterwards, and at least take a cup
of coffee, and a cigarette (for the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span>
did not mind smoking, and indeed once
at Aix-les-Bains he had seen her, etc., etc.),
and sun himself in the smile of royalty.</p>

<p>The Babe received this message at half-past
one; he had refused an invitation to
lunch at King’s on the strength of the
previous engagement, and he was rather
cross. It was too late to go to King’s
now, but after a few moments’ thought,
his face suddenly cleared and he sent a
note to Reggie saying that he would come
round about half-past two, adding that he
had “got an idea,” which they would
work out together. He then ordered some
lunch from the kitchen, which there was
little chance of his receiving for some time,
for all the cooks and kitchen boys who
were not engaged in serving up Mr. Stewart’s
lunch, were busy making little excursions
into the court, where they stood
about with trays on their heads, to give
the impression that they were going to or
from some other rooms, in order to catch
a sight of Mr. Stewart’s illustrious guests
as they crossed the court. However, the
Babe went to the kitchen himself as it did<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span>
not come, and said bitter things to the
head cook who was a Frenchman, and
asked him whether he had already forgotten
about Alsace and Lorraine.</p>

<p>He lunched alone and half-way through
he nearly choked himself with laughing
suddenly, apparently at nothing at all,
and when he had finished he went round
to King’s. He and Reggie talked together
for about an hour, and then went
out shopping.</p>

<p>Later in the day Mr. Stewart called on
the Babe, to express his regret at what
had happened, but his regret was largely
tempered with sober and loyal exultation
at the success of his party. Their Royal
Highnesses had been the embodiment of
royal graciousness and amiability; they
had written their names in his birthday
book, and promised to send their photographs.
The conversation, it appeared,
had been carried on chiefly in French, a
language with which Mr. Stewart was perfectly
acquainted, and which he spoke not
only elegantly, but what is better, intelligibly.
The Princess was the most beauti<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span>ful
and delightful of women, the Prince the
handsomest and most charming of men.
Mr. Stewart, in fact, had quite lost his
heart to them both, and he had promised
to look them up when he next happened
to be travelling in their country, which,
thought the cynical Babe, would probably
be soon. Best of all, Mr. Medingway,
the entertainer of queens, could not talk
French, though he was the first Arabic
scholar in Europe, a language, however,
in which it was not possible for a mixed
company to converse, and he had necessarily
been quite thrown into the shade.</p>

<p>The Babe received this all with the
utmost interest and sympathy. He regretted
that he had not been able to come
in afterwards, but he hoped Mr. Stewart
could come to breakfast next day at nine.
Mr. Stewart both could and would, and
as soon as he had gone, the Babe danced
the <i>pas-de-quatre</i> twice round the room.</p>

<p>That evening Reggie and the Babe
went to call on Jack Marsden who had
come up for a week. Jack was very short,
barely five feet high, but he made up for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span>
that by being very stout. The Babe
also got a fine nib, and employed half an
hour in copying something very carefully
onto the back of a plain black-edged
envelope.</p>

<p>He was up in good time next morning,
and he had three letters by the post.
One of these was black-edged, and had
on the back of the envelope a Royal
Crown, and <i>Windsor Castle</i>. He opened
them all, and left this last face downwards
on the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Stewart came in, still in the best of
spirits, and walked about the room, expatiating
on the superiority of royal families,
while the Babe made tea.</p>

<p>“It makes a difference,” said Stewart,
“it must make a difference, if one’s fathers
and forefathers have been kings. One
would have the habit and the right of
command. I don’t know if I ever told
you&mdash;”</p>

<p>His eye caught sight of the Royal
Crown and Windsor Castle, and he
paused a moment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span></p>
<p>“I don’t know if I ever told you of
that very pleasant day I once spent at
Sandringham.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you told me about it yesterday,”
said the Babe brutally.</p>

<p>“I suppose they are all up in Scotland
now,” said Stewart.</p>

<p>“No, the Queen is at Windsor for a
day or two,” said the Babe. “She goes
up early next week. Will you have a
sole?”</p>

<p>“Thanks&mdash;not a whole one. I asked
because I saw you had a letter here from
Windsor.”</p>

<p>The Babe looked up quickly and just
changed colour&mdash;he could do it quite
naturally&mdash;and picked up his letters.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s from my cousin,” he said.
“She’s in waiting, just now.”</p>

<p>“Lady Julia?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Apparently they are not going
straight up.”</p>

<p>The subject dropped, but a few minutes
later the Babe said suddenly and in an
absent-minded way.</p>

<p>“I don’t think she’s ever been to Cambridge
before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141" id="page_141">{141}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Lady Julia?”</p>

<p>Again the Babe started.</p>

<p>“Yes, Lady Julia. She is thinking of
coming up to&mdash;to see me on Monday.
Is there anything in the papers?”</p>

<p>“I only read the <i>Morning Post</i>,” said
Mr. Stewart. “There is of course a short
account of the Prince’s visit here, but I
saw nothing else.”</p>

<p>For the next day or two the Babe was
very busy, too busy to do much work.
He went more than once with Reggie and
Jack to the A.D.C. where they looked up
several dresses, and he had a long interview
with the proprieter of the Bull. He
took a slip of paper to the printer’s, with
certain elaborate directions, and on Monday
morning there arrived at Trinity a
Bath chair. Then he went to Mr. Stewart,
who was his tutor, and had a short
talk, with the result that at a quarter to
two, Mr. Stewart was pacing agitatedly
up and down his room, stopping always in
front of the window, from which he could
see the staircase on which were the Babe’s
rooms, and on which now appeared a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142">{142}</a></span>
strip of crimson carpet. As luck would
have it Mr. Medingway selected this time
for going to Mr. Stewart’s rooms to borrow
a book and the two looked out of the
window together.</p>

<p>The Trinity clock had just struck two,
when a smart carriage and pair hired from
the Bull stopped at the gate, and the
Babe’s gyp, who had been waiting at the
porter’s lodge, wheeled the Bath chair up
to it. Out of it stepped first the Babe,
next a short stout old lady dressed in
black, and last a very tall young woman
elegantly dressed. She was quite as tall
as the Babe, and seemed the type of the
English woman of the upper class, who
plays lawn-tennis and rides bicycles. The
gyp bowed low as he helped the old lady
into the chair, and the Babe, hat in hand
until the old lady told him to put it on,
and the tall girl walked one on each side
of it. The porter who was just going
into the lodge, stopped dead as they
passed, and also took off his hat, and the
Bath chair passed down an inclined plane
of boards which had been arranged over
the steps into the court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143">{143}</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Stewart, standing with Medingway
at his bow window, saw them enter, and in
a voice trembling with suppressed excitement
said to his companion: “Here they
are,” and though benedictions were not frequent
on his lips, added: “God bless her.”</p>

<p>He pressed Medingway to stop for
lunch, and the two sat down together.</p>

<p>“Was it in the papers this morning?”
asked the latter.</p>

<p>Mr. Stewart took the <i>Morning Post</i>
from the sofa.</p>

<p>“It is only announced that the Court
will leave Windsor to-day. They are expected
at Balmoral on Wednesday, not
Tuesday, you see. It does not give their
movements for to-day.”</p>

<p>Mr. Medingway was looking out of the
window.</p>

<p>“They have got to the staircase,” he
said. “And she is getting out. Are we&mdash;is
anyone going in afterwards?”</p>

<p>“I believe not. It is to be absolutely
quiet, and strictly incognito. They leave
again by the 4.35.”</p>

<p>“An interesting, a unique occasion,”
said Medingway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144">{144}</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; the Babe takes it all so easily.
I wish I had been able to have him to
lunch last week.”</p>

<p>Mr. Medingway smiled, and helped
himself to a slice of galantine.</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t perhaps take a cup of
tea before going&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” said Mr. Stewart, who,
if he was not playing the <i>beau rôle</i> to-day,
at any rate had been in the confidence of
him who was. “The Babe was most urgent
that I should not let it get about.
Indeed, I have committed a breach of confidence
in telling you. Of course I know
it will go no further.”</p>

<p>Meantime, the Babe having successfully
conveyed his party across the court, and
having taken the precaution of sporting
his door, was having lunch. Opposite to
him sat Jack Marsden, dressed in a black
silk gown; on his right Reggie, attired in
the height of fashion. He wore a blue
dress with very full sleeves, and a large
picture hat. He was taking a long draught
of Lager beer.</p>

<p>“Stewart and Medingway both saw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span>”
he said, “and they are both at Stewart’s
window now.”</p>

<p>“It was complete,” said the Babe solemnly,
“wonderfully complete, and the
bogus copy of the <i>Morning Post</i>, which I
substituted for his, was completer still. It
will also puzzle them to know how you get
away, for they are sure to wait there on
the chance of seeing you again. I shouldn’t
wonder if Stewart went to the station.
And now if you’ve finished, you can
change in my bedroom, and we’ll go
round and get a fourth to play tennis.
Stewart must confess that I have gone
one better than either him or Medingway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146" id="page_146">{146}</a></span>”</p>

<span class="i5">&mdash;After <span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ealing</span> had not been up in the Long,
but Reggie and the Babe spent a week
with him early in October, before going
up to Cambridge again. They arrived on
the last day of September, and from morn
till eve on the first day the silly pheasants
fled before the Babe’s innocuous gun.
However, that gentleman said he liked
aiming, without any thought of ulterior
consequences, and that this was the true
essence of sport, and as Reggie and Ealing
were both good shots, it is to be presumed
that everyone, even including the
keeper, was fairly contented.</p>

<p>The October term began as October
terms always begin. There was, as usual,
a far larger number of Freshmen of unique
brilliance than had ever been heard of
before, who were duly asked to coffee
with men of other years after Hall, and
these ceremonies were neither more nor
less exciting than usual. There was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span>
Freshman who wore spectacles, and didn’t
play games because he had a weak heart,
and who when asked from what school he
came, said ‘Giggleswick,’ with almost incredible
coolness; there was the Freshman
who had been captain of the eleven
in some obscure school, and already saw
himself captain of the University team;
there were Freshmen who could play all
kinds of music, the Freshman who played
the flute, and the Freshman who played
the violin, and probably the Freshman
who could play the sackbut and psaltery;
the Freshman who already seemed to
know half the University, and the Freshman
who knew nobody at all; the Freshman
who called his tutor “Sir,” and the
Freshman who very kindly treated him as
one man of the world treats another.
There were the usual trial games of football
played under a tropical sun, and the
usual interminable lists of tubbings put
up in the Reading-Room.</p>

<p>But after a fortnight or so the world in
general, with all its sorts and conditions
of men, settled down into its usual routine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148" id="page_148">{148}</a></span>
the Freshmen who had all started together
diverged into the sets where their particular
tastes attracted them. Some joined
musical societies, and some were put up
and blackballed at a meeting of the old
Giggleswickians; some played in the
Freshmen’s matches, and some bought
college blazers, and passed contented and
leisurely afternoons in canoes on the
Backs. Alan St. Aubyn published his
annual humorous libel on what he playfully
called University Life, and the Babe
moved from Malcolm Street into the rooms
he had occupied in the Long in the Great
Court Trinity, and Mr. Sykes signalised
the occasion by killing the under-porter’s
best cat.</p>

<p>No doubt it was primarily the best cat’s
fault, for she had taken an independent
and solitary walk on her own account
down Trinity Street, and Sykes who was
waiting at the gate, quite quiet and as
good as gold, for the Babe, who had gone
into his room to put down his cap and
gown, saw her returning. So he killed
her. Of course he had to tell the Babe<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_149" id="page_149">{149}</a></span>
about it, and he thought the best plan
would be to take the mangled corpse&mdash;she
was not neatly killed&mdash;to the Babe’s
rooms, which, though he was not allowed
in college, he happened to know, and the
first thing the porter saw was Mr. Sykes
racing across the grass with his best cat
hopelessly defunct, dangling from his
mouth. He followed, but Sykes got
there first, and was wagging his stumpy
tail with a pleased air, as he deposited
his burden on the hearth-rug, when the
infuriated porter entered.</p>

<p>The porter said:</p>

<p>(I.) That Sykes had no business to kill
his cat.</p>

<p>(II.) That he had, if possible, even less
business in college.</p>

<p>(III.) That Sykes ought to be poisoned.</p>

<p>The Babe answered:</p>

<p>(I.) That there was no question of
poisoning Sykes.</p>

<p>(II.) That the death must have taken
place outside college, for he had seen
Sykes enter with the corpse in his mouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">{150}</a></span></p>

<p>(III.) That the cat had no more business
in Trinity Street than Sykes had in
college, so it was six of one and half a
dozen of the other.</p>

<p>(IV.) That Sykes should be beaten.</p>

<p>(V.) That, though the cat was not
worth it, sentiment went for something,
and there was such a thing as a sovereign.</p>

<p>So Sykes was beaten there and then
with a rug strap, and the porter had a sovereign,
and the beaten Sykes was granted
safe conduct out of college again.</p>

<p>The Babe took a hansom down to the
theatre, for he was going to rehearse for
the Greek play, and blew tobacco smoke
at Sykes all the way to show him he was
in disgrace. He had not much wanted to
act, for it meant six weeks of rehearsing
and learning his part, but he had consented
to read through the play and see whether
the part of Clytemnestra in the <i>Agamemnon</i>
did not recommend itself to him. This
had of course ended in his undertaking it,
and he found that though he had dropped
Greek for two years, he did not experience
much difficulty in learning his part.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span></p>

<p>The theatre where the <i>Agamemnon</i> was
to be performed was a curiously shabby
building, resembling an overgrown barn,
one of the “greater barns,” so said the
Babe, mentioned in a parable. A low
tunnel, resembling the subway in Metropolitan
underground stations led into it
from the street, and from the tunnel opened
various doors, which led into rooms resembling
economically constructed kennels.
One of these, humorously called
the smoking-room, presumably because
the audience invariably smoked in the
passage, was rendered additionally alluring
by a long, low plank, like those supplied
to third class waiting-rooms, which
ran down the length of it. The outer wall,
in all its unveiled glory of brick and mortar,
was further decorated by photographs of
the Compton Company, in which actors
and actresses alike seemed devoured by
a futile endeavour to acquire those casts
of expression which are associated with
“persons of genius and sensibility.” A
man was engaged in kindling reluctant
footlights when the Babe entered, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152">{152}</a></span>
had time to bestow the minutest attention
on the very vivid drop-scene which
was down, before the others appeared.
It represented a gloomy and nameless
marsh, in the corner of which was moored
a magenta boat, into which a young lady
in a green bonnet was being assisted by a
young gentleman of abhorrent demeanour
and odiously familiar manner. He wore
a straw hat and a blue frock-coat, and was
smoking an enormous cigar. Over their
heads hovered a gigantic bird of prey,
probably a vulture, confident no doubt
that the fatal exhalations from the marsh,
or their own unfitness to live, would soon
supply him with a delicate supper composed
of the remains of this ill-attired
pair. A painted but unexplained Venetian
mast&mdash;in popular language, a barber’s
pole&mdash;stuck out of the bulrushes in the
middle distance, and behind, the sun appeared
to have just set in a gory sky over
the mountains, which stood up brilliantly
blue in the background.</p>

<p>It was a miserably cold morning, and
Clytemnestra sat in a thick ulster with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153" id="page_153">{153}</a></span>
bull-dog on her knees, till it was time for
her to appear, and watched a curiously
dressed chorus of Argive elders headed
by Reggie in flannels and a blazer, for he
had been playing tennis, manœuvre round
a stage director, whom a vivid imagination
construed into an altar. Two other
stage directors quarrelled with each other
in the background, till the conductor who
was directing the chorus asked them to
be quiet. Thus he secured for himself
the hostility of all the stage directors, who
resented the attack made on their class,
and who lay in wait to contradict him
rudely on the earliest possible occasion.</p>

<p>The Babe, meantime, had wandered off
the stage into the wings, in search of a
fire, and Mr. Sykes, left to himself, recognised
Reggie as a friend among the heterogeneous
elders, and trotted across to him,
wheezing pathetically. The conductor
had stopped the chorus in order to point
out some mistake the tenors had made,
and was singing the passage himself in a
fruity falsetto voice, and Reggie, who was
a bass, was patting Sykes, when the voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154">{154}</a></span>
of one of the hostile stage directors broke
in&mdash;</p>

<p>“The rehearsal,” he said firmly, “will
proceed when the leader of the Argive
elders has quite finished playing with a
bull-dog. Please send the bull-dog out of
the theatre.”</p>

<p>“It’s Clytemnestra’s,” said Reggie.</p>

<p>The Babe re-appeared at this moment.</p>

<p>“Where’s Bill?” he asked. “Oh, there
he is. Come here, darling. Oh, are you
waiting for me?”</p>

<p>The conductor laid down his baton.</p>

<p>“Settle it among yourselves,” he said,
“and tell me when you are ready. I may
remark that I am very busy, and that my
time is not my own.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sykes meantime was sniffing suspiciously
round the heels of the altar, and
the altar was getting visibly nervous.</p>

<p>The Babe supposing that his entrance
had come, began reciting his first lines in
a loud voice, and the stage directors and
the conductors made common cause against
him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155">{155}</a></span></p>

<p>“If Clytemnestra would kindly be
quiet,” said one.</p>

<p>“And take away her horrible dog,” put
in the altar.</p>

<p>“The chorus might proceed,” shouted
the conductor.</p>

<p>The Babe with a look of injured innocence
on his face retired to his chair, followed
reluctantly by Sykes, who was not
satisfied about the altar, and the practice
went on.</p>

<p>But the truce between the conductor
and the stage directors was only an armed
neutrality. One of them in particular, a
bustling little man with a honey-coloured
moustache and a Paderewski head of hair,
was waiting to fall upon him. He was a
student of all branches of what Stewart
would have called “delightful and useless
knowledge”; on such subjects he has perhaps
a wider and more elaborately specialised
information than any man in England.
He could have told you with the most
minute particulars the exact shape of the
earrings worn by Greek women of the fifth
century <small>B.C.</small>, the particular way in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_156" id="page_156">{156}</a></span>
athletes of the fourth century brushed
their hair, the conformation of the lobe of
the ear in female statues of the third century,
or the proportionate length of the
little finger nail to the eye-socket in
bronzes of the Hadrian epoch. He could
have prescribed you the ingredients which
made the red in Botticelli’s Tobias, lasting,
through the want of which Turner’s
sunsets paled almost as fast as the sunsets
themselves; he had penetrated into the
dens of the forgers at Rome which lie in
the street which no one can find between
the Via Nazionale and the Capitol; he had
been twice round the world, and spoke
five dialects of Mexican; he had looked on
the city of Mecca, and kodaked the interior
of the mosque of the Seven Curses
of the Prophet; he had dived for pearls in
the Coromandel Sea, and evaded by a
hair-breadth the jaws of the blue-nosed
shark as it rolled over on its back to snap
him in two; he knew intimately a lineal
descendant of Adamo di Brescia, the coiner
of the Inferno, and asserted that in all
probability the forefather was a clumsier<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157">{157}</a></span>
workman than his son, or he would never
have been detected. And on all these
subjects and many others equally abstruse
he could give you statistics, as dry as the
facts themselves were interesting. Once
or twice, it is true, he had been caught in
an apparent error, but he had always been
able to give a perfectly satisfactory explanation
of it afterwards, with hardly any
time for reflection. Such qualifications
had eminently fitted him for the part of
stage-manager in a Greek play, and he
certainly added to these, immense zeal and
industry. His name was Propert, and
his college was Peterhouse.</p>

<p>For some minutes he stood grasping
his hair with both hands in an incipient
frenzy, as the chorus proceeded, but at
last he could stand it no longer, and he
clapped his hands loudly.</p>

<p>“It is all wrong,” he said, “you have
not got the spirit of it. You do not sound
the note of fate. Those last bars should
be a long low wail, prophetic of woe, and
<i>pianissimo&mdash;pianissimo ma con smorgando
tremuloso</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span>”</p>

<p>He patted the air in front of Reggie,
with an eloquent gesture.</p>

<p>“They are marked <i>ff.</i>,” said the leader
of the Argive elders in good plain English.</p>

<p>“Well, you must erase your double
forte,” said Dr. Propert.</p>

<p>The conductor folded his arms, and
waited till Dr. Propert had retired up
O. P.</p>

<p>“We will now begin again four bars
back, at the double forte,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>pianissimo</i>,” said the doctor turning
round.</p>

<p>The Argive elders looked puzzled. Diplomacy,
to judge by their speeches, was
not their strong point.</p>

<p>“Are we to do it double forte or <i>pianissimo</i>?”
asked Reggie of the conductor.</p>

<p>“I presume that Doctor Propert has
informed Professor Damien of the alterations
he has thought fit to make in the
music,” he remarked bitterly.</p>

<p>But as Doctor Propert was already employed
in showing Agamemnon, who was
about to enter, how to lean against a door<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">{159}</a></span>
in the attitude of a Sophoclean adult, the
sarcasm fell innocuous, and the practice
proceeded <i>fortissimo</i> without further interruption.</p>

<p>Agamemnon had forgotten his first line,
and at Dr. Propert’s suggestion said
“Boble, boble, boble,” until he remembered
the second or third lines, and the
chorus grouped themselves round the
watchmen and smoked, while the altar,
relieved of its localising duties, quarrelled
with the other unemployed directors, and
prompted Agamemnon intermittently.</p>

<p>But as the scene between Agamemnon
and Clytemnestra proceeded and the Babe
warmed to his work, other conversation
drooped and died. He found it bored
him simply to say the part, and throughout
the rehearsals, even when he had to
read his part, he acted it all. But at this
stage in rehearsal he knew it by heart,
and in looking at him one quite forgot his
deerstalker cap and long, loud ulster.
The stage directors were reconciled and
murmured approbation, the conductor
ceased talking to the watchmen, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160">{160}</a></span>
thing began to take shape. Even the
subsequent appearance of Mr. Sykes, who
sat down in the middle of the stage and
smiled at the chorus, caused no interruption.
He fell perfectly flat, and no one
took the slightest notice of him.</p>

<p>Once only was there an interruption,
and that was made by the Babe himself.
Dr. Propert was busy hauling a metope
on to the stage, and letting go of it for a
moment, it fell resonantly onto its back.
The Babe stopped dead, and turned
round.</p>

<p>“If you make such a horrible row again,
while I’m on,” he said, “you may take
the part of Clytemnestra yourself. I shall
begin again,” he added severely, “at the
beginning of my speech.”</p>

<p>The conductor could have embraced the
Babe on the spot, and the other stage
managers giggled. The Babe waited till
they had quite finished, and then began
again thirty-four lines back.</p>

<p>The truth was that all the Babe’s flippancy
and foolishness left him when he
was acting, and only then, for acting was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_161" id="page_161">{161}</a></span>
the one thing he took quite seriously. He
ceased to be himself, for he threw himself
completely into the character he was impersonating.
He was in fact not an amateur,
but an actor, and these two have
nothing whatever to do with one another.
If a man has dramatic power, he may
become an actor with training, without it
he cannot. And most amateurs have not
got it.</p>

<p>So the play proceeded with vigour till
Clytemnestra went off with Ægisthus,
and shortly after in a hansom with Mr.
Sykes. The cold drizzle of the morning
had turned to snow, and the melting snow
in the streets looked like thin coffee ice.
The Babe was playing in a college match
that afternoon, and the prospect filled
him with a mild despair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162">{162}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A College Sunday.</span></h2>

<span class="i0">“This gloomy tone,” he said, “is far too rife;<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Reggie</span> and Ealing had moved into a
set of rooms in Fellows’ Buildings, which
they shared together. The set consisted
of three rooms, two inner and smaller
ones, and one large room looking out on
to the front court of King’s. The two
smaller rooms they used as bedrooms, but
as they each had folding Eton beds, by
half-past nine or so every morning, provided
that they got up in reasonable time,
they were converted for the day into
sitting-rooms. The outer room was furnished
more with regard to what furniture
they had, than what furniture it required.
Thus there were two pianos, tuned about
a quarter of a tone apart from each other,
two grandfather’s clocks, and a most deficient
supply of chairs. “However,” as
Reggie said, “one can always sit on the
piano.”</p>

<p>Ealing’s powers of execution on the
piano were limited. He could play hymn<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_163" id="page_163">{163}</a></span>-tunes,
or other compositions, where the
next chord to the one he was engaged on
followed as a corollary from it, and anything
in the world which went so slowly
as to enable him to glance from the music
to his hands between each chord, however
complicated it was, provided it did not
contain a double sharp, which he always
played wrong. He could also, by dint
of long practice, play “Father O’Flynn”
and the first verse of “Off to Philadelphia
in the Morning”; and there seemed to
be no reason why, with industry, he should
not be able to acquire the power of playing
the other verses, in which he considered
the chords to be most irregular
and unexpected, deserting the air at the
most crucial points. Reggie, however, was
far more accomplished. He had got past
hymn-tunes. The Intermezzo in <i>Cavaleria
Rusticana</i>&mdash;even the palpitating part&mdash;was
from force of repetition mere child’s
play to him, and he aspired to the slow
movements out of Beethoven’s Sonatas.</p>

<p>The hours in which each might practise,
therefore, demanded careful arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164">{164}</a></span>ment.
College regulations forbade the
use of the pianos altogether between nine
in the morning, and two in the afternoon,
since it was popularly supposed by
the authorities who framed this rule&mdash;and
who shall say them nay&mdash;that all
undergraduates worked between these
hours, and that the sound of a piano
would disturb them. Consequently, Ealing
was allowed to play between eight
<small>A.M.</small> and nine <small>A.M.</small>, every morning, a privilege
which he used intermittently during
breakfast, and by which he drove
Reggie, daily, to the verge of insanity,
and Reggie between two <small>P.M.</small> and three
<small>P.M.</small> Ealing again might play between
three and five, and Reggie from five to
seven. During these hours the temporary
captain of the pianos, even if he
did not wish to play himself, might stop
the other from playing except with the
soft pedal down. It had been found impossible
to regulate the hours after dinner,
and they often played simultaneously on
their several pianos, and produced thereby
very curious and interesting effects, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_165" id="page_165">{165}</a></span>
sounded Wagnerian at a sufficient distance.
Finally, the use of the piano was
totally prohibited by common consent between
two <small>A.M.</small> and eight <small>A.M.</small></p>

<p>The Babe, like mournful Œnone, “hither
came at noon” one Sunday morning.
Chapel at King’s was at half-past ten, and
that English habit of mind which weds
indissolubly together Sunday morning and
lying in bed, was responsible for the fact
that on Sunday Reggie and Ealing always
breakfasted after chapel. But the Babe,
unlike that young lady, was in the best of
spirits, and as Ealing and Reggie were
not yet back from chapel, made tea and began
breakfast without them. They came
in a few minutes later, both rather cross.</p>

<p>“When there is going to be a sermon,”
said Reggie severely, taking off his surplice,
“I consider that I have a right to
be told. Morning, Babe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, have you had a sermon?” said
the Babe sweetly. “Who preached?”</p>

<p>“The Dean. He preached for half-an-hour.”</p>

<p>“More than half-an-hour,” said Ealing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166">{166}</a></span>
“Totally inaudible, of course, but lengthy
to make up for that.”</p>

<p>“Pour me out some tea, Babe, if you’ve
had the sense to make it.”</p>

<p>“Sermons are trying if one hasn’t
breakfasted,” said the Babe. “They are
sermons in stones when one asks for
bread.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea. I hoped
that perhaps one of you would know.
Why should I know what I mean? It’s
other people’s business to find out. And
they for the most part neglect it shamefully.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Babe,” growled Reggie. “I
wish you wouldn’t talk when I’m eating.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you hear yourself eat?” asked
the Babe sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Wild horses shall not drag me to
Chapel this afternoon,” said Ealing.
“We’ll go for a walk, Reggie.”</p>

<p>“I daresay: at present I can’t think of
anything but food. Babe, you greedy
hog, give me some fish.”</p>

<p>“And very good fish it is,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167">{167}</a></span>
Babe genially. “By the way, Sykes is
far from well this morning.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with him?”</p>

<p>“He partook too freely of the anchovies
of the Chitchat last night. You will
find that in French conversation books.”</p>

<p>“I saw him indulging as I thought
unwisely,” said Ealing. “Then it was
surely imprudent of him to drink Moselle
cup.”</p>

<p>“He wished to drown care, but it only
gave him a stomach-ache. Stewart impressed
him so with the fact that we were
all Atlases with the burden of the world
on our shoulders, that he had recourse
to the cup.”</p>

<p>“And the burden of us all was on
Stewart.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t you remember he said
that he felt personally responsible for
every undergraduate whom he had ever
spoken to? His idea is that each don
ought to have an unlimited influence,
and that the whole future of England
in the next generation lay on each of
them, particularly himself. No wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168">{168}</a></span>
his eyelids were a little weary, as Mr.
Pater says. But after you went he took
the other side, and said that the undergraduates
were the <i>raison d’être</i> of the
University, and that the dons existed
only by their sufferance.”</p>

<p>“Did Longridge stop?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He was a little less coherent
than usual. I know he took the case of
a man at Oxford who threw stones at the
deer in Magdalen, though what conclusion
he drew from it, I can’t say.”</p>

<p>“Probably that the deer were really
responsible for the undergraduates.”</p>

<p>The Babe sighed.</p>

<p>“I have to read a paper next week. I
think it shall be on some aspects of Longridge.
That is sure to give rise to a discussion
if he is there. Give me a cigarette,
Reggie.”</p>

<p>The Babe established himself in a big
chair by the fireplace, while the others
finished breakfast.</p>

<p>“I am going to found a club,” he said,
“called the S.C.D. or Society for the
Cultivation of Dons. Stewart says he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169" id="page_169">{169}</a></span>
will be vice-president, as he doesn’t consider
himself a don. We are going to
call on obscure dons every afternoon and
speak to them of the loveliness of life,
for, as Stewart says, the majority of
them have no conception of it. Their
lives are bounded by narrow horizons,
and the only glimpse they catch of the
great world, is their bed-maker as she
carries out their slop-pail from their bedrooms.
They live like the Niebelungs
in dark holes and eat roots, and though
they are merely animals, they have no
animal spirits. He says he knew a don
once who by a sort of process of spontaneous
combustion, became a dictionary,
but all the interesting words, the sort of
words one looks out in a Bible dictionary,
you know, were missing. So they used
him to light fires with, for which he was
admirably adapted, being very dry, and
in the manner of King Alexander, who,
as Stewart asserted, became the bung in
a wine cork, other dons now warm themselves
at him. Stewart was very entertaining
last night, and rather improper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">{170}</a></span>
He said that a Don Juan or two was
wanted among the dons, by way of compensation,
and he enlarged on the subject.”</p>

<p>“Give us his enlargements.”</p>

<p>“I can’t. He enlarged in a way that
belongs to the hour after midnight on
Saturday, when you know that when you
wake up it will be Sunday. He was very
Saturday-night. He called it working off
the arrears of the week, and complained
that he hadn’t heard a mouth-filling oath
for more than a month. He never swears
himself, but he likes to hear other people
do it; for he says he is in a morbid terror
of the millennium beginning without his
knowing it. He skipped about in short
skirted epigrams, and pink-tight phrases.
At least that was his account of his own
conversation when we parted. Oh yes,
and he said he didn’t mind saying these
things to me because I was a man of the
world.”</p>

<p>“He knows your weak points, Babe,”
said Reggie.</p>

<p>“Not at all. He referred to that as my
strong point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">{171}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Good old Clytemnestra! I’m better
now, thank you, after my breakfast, and
it’s ‘The Sorrows of Death’ this afternoon.
I shall go to chapel again.”</p>

<p>Reggie lit a pipe, and picked out the
first few bars on the piano.</p>

<p>“The watchman was a tiresome sort of
man to have about,” he said. “When they
asked him if it was nearly morning, he only
said, ‘Though the morning will come, the
night will come also.’ Of course they knew
that already, and besides it wasn’t the
question. I should have dismissed him on
the spot. So the soprano has to tell them,
which he does on the top A mainly.”</p>

<p>“When I was a child I could sing the
upper upper Z,” said the Babe fatuously.
“Then my voice broke, and the moral is
‘Deeper and deeper yet.’ Don’t rag:
I apologise.”</p>

<p>Ealing finished breakfast last, and
strolled across to the window.</p>

<p>“It’s a heavenly morning,” he said.
“Let’s go out. We needn’t go far.”</p>

<p>“I will walk no further than the King’s
field,” said the Babe.</p>

<p>“Very well, and we can sit outside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172" id="page_172">{172}</a></span>
pavilion. I’m lunching out at half-past
one.”</p>

<p>“Meals do run together so on Sunday.
Sunday is really one long attack of confluent
mastication,” said the Babe. “It’s
a pity one can’t take them simultaneously.”</p>

<p>Though November had already begun,
the air was deliciously warm and mild,
and had it not been for the fast yellowing
trees, one would have guessed it to be
May. But there was a shouting wind
overhead, which stripped off the leaves
by hundreds and blew the rooks about the
sky. Already the tops of the trees were
bare, and the nests of last spring swung
empty and half ruined high up among the
forks of the branches. During the last
week a good deal of rain had fallen, and
the Cam was swirling down, yellow and
turbid. The willow by the river was
already quite bare, and its thin feathery
branches lashed themselves against the
stone coping of the bridge.</p>

<p>They went through the Fellows’ gardens,
for Reggie by some means had got
hold of a key; there a few bushes of drag<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_173" id="page_173">{173}</a></span>gled
Michaelmas daisies were making pretence
that the summer was not quite dead
yet, but they only succeeded in calling
attention to the long, desolate beds. The
grass was growing rank and matted under
the autumn rains, and little eddies of leaves
had drifted up against the wires of the
disused croquet-hoops. But the day itself
seemed stolen from off the lap of spring,
and two thrushes were singing in the
bushes after an excellent breakfast of succulent
worms.</p>

<p>“We play you to-morrow at Rugger,”
remarked the Babe as they walked across
the field, “and we play on this ground.
It’s sticky enough, and I shall vex the
soul of the half opposite me, because I
like a sticky ground, and he is certain not
to. In fact,” said he confidently, “I purpose
to get two tries off my own bat, and
generally to sit on this royal and ancient
foundation.”</p>

<p>“The Babe has never yet been called
modest,” said Ealing.</p>

<p>“If I have, I am not aware of it,” said
the Babe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_174" id="page_174">{174}</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ve got three blues,” remarked
Reggie.</p>

<p>“I am delighted to hear it,” said the
Babe. “You will need them all. And
you may tell our mutual friend Hargreave
that if he attempts to collar me round the
ancles again, I shall make no efforts whatever
to avoid kicking him in the face.
He did it last time we played you, and I
spoke to him about it more in sorrow
than in anger.”</p>

<p>“Upon which the referee warned you
for using sorrowful language.”</p>

<p>“He did take that liberty,” conceded
the Babe. “Let’s sit down outside the
pavilion. I wish we could kick about.
The Sabbath is made for man, and so is
Sunday, and so are footballs.”</p>

<p>“But on Sunday the pavilion is locked
up by man, and the footballs put inside.”</p>

<p>“It appears so. English people take
Sunday too seriously, just as they take
everything else, except me.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, Stewart says you are a man
of the world,” said Ealing.</p>

<p>“He does, and who are we to con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175">{175}</a></span>tradict
him? Good Lord, there’s one
o’clock striking. I must go home.
There’s somebody coming to lunch at
half-past. Reggie, get me a ticket for
King’s this afternoon, will you?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_176" id="page_176">{176}</a></span>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reggie</span> and the Babe got into chapel
just after the voluntary had begun, and
slow soft notes came floating drowsily
down from the echoes in the roof. The
chapel and ante-chapel were both full, and
from the door in the dim, mellow half-darkness,
a sea of heads stretched up to
the black wooden screen, through which
streamed the light from the chapel itself.
In the roof one could just see the delicate
fan-shaped lines of vaulting springing
across like lotus leaves from wall to wall,
and the windows on the south side
gleamed with dark, rich colour from the
sky already turning red with the southwestern
setting sun. As they went up
the ante-chapel the Babe saw a seat still
unoccupied, and preferred stopping there
to going into the chapel.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_177" id="page_177">{177}</a></span></p>

<p>Reggie’s seat was just east of the choir
opposite to the window representing
Christ standing in the garden after the
resurrection. To the right kneels Mary
Magdalene gaudily dressed, just having
turned and seeing that he was not, as she
supposed, only the gardener. To the left
rises a green hill, on the top of which,
below a row of brown, ragged rocks,
stands the empty tomb, with the women
round it. By a quaint but curiously felicitous
idea of the artist, the figure of
Christ is holding a spade in his hand, as
if to give colour to Mary’s mistake. His
face is Divine, but graciously human, and
he waits for the recognition.</p>

<p>The whole place had an air of tranquil
repose, of remoteness from worldliness,
hurry, and unprofitable strivings that perhaps
has a certain value, which is not
necessarily diminished because it is impossible
to account for it statistically or
categorically. There is something in
spacious grey buildings and perfect Gothic
architecture, shared too by broad grass
lawns and studious, quiet places and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_178" id="page_178">{178}</a></span>
uneventful lives, that cannot be altogether
left out of the reckoning when one adds
up the total value of a University as compared
with a modern endowed plan of
education, or the admirable schemes of
University extension.</p>

<p>And the choir which walked slowly up
the aisle into their places, though composed
of ordinary little boys, lay clerks,
and undergraduates, somehow brought
themselves into harmony with it. On
week days the little boys no doubt were
entirely human, and probably concealed
surreptitious sweet stuff in their pockets;
the lay clerks wore bowler hats and tail
coats, and belonged to the most unprepossessing
class which England produces,
and the undergraduates were only undergraduates.
But for the time they were
part of a wonderful idea, and were performing
the office set apart for them by a
royal founder.</p>

<p>The last echo from the roof died away,
and the service began, and though Reggie
was not conscious of attending very
closely to it, he was still aware of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179">{179}</a></span>
good and kindly atmosphere about him,
an atmosphere which soothed and quieted,
and drove the thoughts inward. He had
often felt it before, on other winter afternoons
in chapel, and as far as he knew,
for he did not consciously think about it,
it had made no difference to him. But as
no impression is without its effects, we must
presume that it had made a difference to
him, though he had not been aware of it.</p>

<p>Not long before, the organ had been
repaired, and in great part renewed, and
it was worthy of its surroundings and its
appearance. Golden sheaves of pipes
gleamed out between the dark wooden
case, and on top of the two turrets looking
west, stood two great angels with
brazen trumpets to their mouths, and
when the “tuba” speaks, one cannot help
imagining that it is their trumpets which
are sounding. To-day “The Lord thundered
out of heaven,” and one could think
that the air for a moment grew thick with
sound, which increased till it shattered
the growing darkness, splitting it with
lightning made audible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_180" id="page_180">{180}</a></span></p>

<p>By the end of the Psalms it had grown
quite dark outside, and the windows
showed black between the delicate tracery.
From the lectern came the story of Nebuchadnezzar’s
dream, “of the watcher and
the Holy One,” and afterwards of the
Holy One who watched alone among the
olives in the Garden of Gethsemane, a
king, not of Babylon, but of the whole
earth, who had not where to lay his head.</p>

<p>The stalls and sub-stalls were all full
of members of the college, in surplices,
but the black crowd beyond stretched up
to the steps of the altar, and when the
three bars of introduction to the solo
began, every one stood up. Mendelssohn,
so often only correct, so often ruined by
his fatal prettiness, has here struck the
right note, full and firm. Even Reggie
ceased to think of the evasiveness of the
watchman, and only listened, till the repeated
call of the minor died away into a
long pause before the soprano answered,
and the choir took up the full chorus.</p>

<p>Outside in the ante-chapel, though only
for a little while, the Babe ceased from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_181" id="page_181">{181}</a></span>
customary futility of thought, and the
slow opening of the carved wooden doors
in the screen, and the drawing of the
crimson curtain, at the end of service, still
found him meditative.</p>

<p>As the choir came out, framed in a long
shaft of light, the organ was played quietly,
and then paused for a moment, while a
great pedal note made the air shake and
quiver in sensation rather than sound.
Then the full organ burst out with the
<i>Occasional Overture</i>, as the congregation
from the chapel streamed out after the
members of the college. The first movement
marched, and marching marshalled
whole armies of sound, which stood waiting
while the second rippled and laughed
and sang with all the breezes of heaven
behind it, and the third dwelt dreamily
on what had gone, and thought of what
was to come.</p>

<p>Then in the last movement, battalion
after battalion of major chords, from choir
and swell and great organ, grew and multiplied
in all their forces, the flutes and piccolos,
the twelfths and fifteenths as flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_182" id="page_182">{182}</a></span>
squadrons on the wings, and the diapasons
the lords of sound in the centre, an exceeding
great army. Then at the second
repeat the “tuba” woke in the “huge
house of sounds,” and the thing was
complete, a fixed star for ever in the
heavens of harmony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_183" id="page_183">{183}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> evening the Babe dined as a
guest with the T.A.F. (which means
Twice A Fortnight, and is a synonym for
O.A.W. or Once A Week, and implies
a frankly purposeless and purely social
club consisting of about a dozen members,
chiefly undergraduates, who dined together
every Sunday night) and spent a
pleasant evening of innocent mirth and a
little music. After dinner one member
sang some Scotch songs in a baritone
voice, another played the Pilgrim’s March
in <i>Tannhäuser</i> exceedingly badly, omitting
the Venus motif, but repeating the
Chorus in a palpitating manner in the
higher octave, to make up for it, and two
others recalled to their minds the <i>Occasional
Overture</i> which had been played
in chapel that afternoon. A fifth imitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_184" id="page_184">{184}</a></span>
in the most natural and life-like manner
the speech and manners of a don of the
college, three or four read books gloomily
in corners, being of a more serious turn
of mind, and the wilder section of the
party pressed the Babe to give them a
little skirt-dancing, which he very properly
refused to do, feeling justly enough that it
would not be in keeping with the general
character of the proceedings. Later he
very unwisely offered to play picquet with
anybody, a proposition which was received
in awkward silence, and hurriedly covered
with a buzz of conversation. Another
guest, however, contributed to the harmony
of the evening by describing at
great length, the state of the lower classes
in Russia, Germany, Austria, and Turkey
in Asia, with realistic and revolting details.
By degrees the other members of the
party left their books and their music, and
sat round him in enthusiastic silence.
For so stirring a man, so thought the
Babe, there was no excuse and no hope,
for he was not less than thirty years old,
and should have known better. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_185" id="page_185">{185}</a></span>
reverted, also at length, to the vastly
superior conditions of our own agricultural
labourers and proceeded, still monologising,
by easy transitions, to the prospect
of an European war. On this point his
prophecies were most patriotic, and went
perfectly to the tune of “Rule Britannia,”
and so afforded everyone present the
greatest satisfaction when they reflected
that they were Englishmen. Metaphorically
speaking he slapped them on the
back, and filled them full of roast beef
and racial admiration. All his sentiments
were worthy of the highest praise, and it
may only have been the personality of
the speaker that inspired the Babe with
such speechless horror. He was just
describing the apparatus for shooting torpedoes
from submerged tubes on the
<i>Majestic</i>, which, in some obscure manner
the passport of Prince Niktivoffski, which
he happened to have about him, had
enabled him to inspect, and was saying that
no other nation had got anything of the
kind and that they would blow all other
navies of the world into a million of atoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186">{186}</a></span>
in a moment of time, when the breaking
point came for the Babe, and he rose and
said good-night.</p>

<p>He had not got more than half way
across the court, when he heard other
sounds of revelry from some rooms on the
right, belonging as he knew to a don of
his acquaintance, who was widely and
justly famed for his Sunday evenings at
home, and the pleasure-seeking Babe
determined to go in for a few minutes, for
like the rest of the University, he had a
standing invitation to come as often as
he could. He found himself in a luxuriously
furnished room, quite full of people
and of mixed tobacco smoke. His host
greeted him effusively, and gave him to
understand that his cup of happiness was
now quite full.</p>

<p>The gathering was meant to be, and
succeeded in being, altogether heterogeneous,
and though eminently respectable,
had a curious but unmistakable flavour
of ultra-Bohemianism about it. Mr. Swotcham
was sitting on the sofa near the fire
talking excitedly to two shaggy individu<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_187" id="page_187">{187}</a></span>als,
whom the Babe rightly guessed to be
members of the club, which he had libellously
informed the world was the modern
representative of the Hell-fire Club of
Medmenham Abbey. He smiled benignantly
at Swotcham, and as he turned away
caught the words “standpoint of determinism.”
He had not the slightest idea
what they meant, but they sounded bad.
By the table, nibbling biscuits and helping
themselves to tea out of a brass Russian
samovar, were standing three little men,
with little moustaches, talking earnestly
together, whose only characteristic seemed
to be entire ineffectiveness. Further on
a highly-coloured Italian was expressing
fervid thoughts in bad English, to two
young gentlemen who wore their hair in
a great frizzled tuft over their foreheads.
This latter type was familiar to the Babe,
and afforded him almost infinite delight;
it went to the stalls in the theatre,
where, dressed in Norfolk jackets, it
talked together in dark allusiveness of
music-hall <i>artistes</i>. It might also be seen
in the streets, in a very short and ragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188" id="page_188">{188}</a></span>
gown, a broken-backed cap with the cardboard
showing at the edges, not the result
of age, but of fell and evil design, smoking
pipes. It gave the world to understand
that it was the very devil of a type,
but the world, with a charity that is rare,
considered that though odious, it was not
morally so black as its self-depreciation led
it to paint itself.</p>

<p>Arundel prints hung on the walls, and
somehow looked as incongruous there as
Mrs. Chant at a music-hall, for the whole
atmosphere was quite extraordinarily secular.
Against the wall stood three or four
large bookcases, on the top of which
were arranged several admirable reproductions
of antique bronzes and marbles.
In one corner on the top of a scagliola
pedestal stood the bust of the young
Augustus in marble, and close to him a
bronze Narcissus leaned and held up a
listening finger. On each side of the
clock on the mantel-piece was a nude
figure of a youth in bronze, and Botticelli’s
Madonna of the Magnificat looked
down at them in mild surprise and seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189" id="page_189">{189}</a></span>
to be wondering to what sort of a place
she had come. From a door on the right
came the sounds of the slow movement
of Beethoven’s <i>Sonata Pathétique</i>, arranged
not as the composer mean it to be
played, but for a cello, a violin and a
piano; the piano was a little ahead, but
the violin and cello which were running
neck to neck, caught up to it in the scherzo
that followed, and they all finished up
amid indescribable indifference on the part
of all present, a dead heat. Everyone
talked loudly during the performance, and
took not the slightest notice when it was
over, with the exception of the genial
host, who patted all three executants on
the back and said “Awfully jolly, Charlie,”
to the cellist. The duty of a good host,
without doubt, is to make everybody talk,
and certainly the musicians and Mr.
Waddilove between them succeeded to
admiration. The latter was as ubiquitous
and as deft as Mr. Maskelyne’s hands
when he is spinning plates, now giving
a touch to the discussion on the standpoint
of determinism, now spurring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190">{190}</a></span>
Italian on to fresh deeds of violence towards
the Queen’s English, now telling the
Babe how he too, in his earlier years, once
acted Clytemnestra with unparalleled success,
and now persuading Charlie to give
him another taste of his cello. In fact,
the only group he did not speak to was
that of the three earnest biscuit-nibblers,
who had been joined by a fourth, and who
appeared to be of no consequence whatever,
as indeed they were not.</p>

<p>Beyond the room where the music was
going on, lay another smaller one, entirely
lined with bookcases from floor to ceiling.
In one corner stood a screen, and the Babe
having the curiosity to peep over it, saw
behind, Mr. Waddilove’s bed, presided
over by a bronze reproduction of the
head of “Sleep” from the British Museum.
On the table stood a liqueur decanter
containing a pale pink fluid of which the
Babe took a glass. It reminded him
vaguely of almonds and orange peel dissolved
in cherry blossom scent, and Mr.
Waddilove entering at the moment told
him it was made exclusively on the estate<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191">{191}</a></span>
of Count Zamboletto near Taormina in
Sicily, where he himself had often stayed.</p>

<p>Fresh arrivals kept streaming in; among
them two or three members of the T.A.F.,
who wandered about looking as if they did
not know why they had come, including
the performer of the overture to <i>Tannhaüser</i>,
who sat down at the piano, without
being asked, and did it again. He
appeared to rouse little or no enthusiasm,
and left immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>In the music-room the President of the
Union had got hold of Mr. Waddilove for
a moment, and was discussing the sanitary
arrangements of the Union with
him, and particularly whether it was possible
to stop the thefts of nail-scissors
which went on so extensively in the lavatory,
and which for no explicable reason,
he was inclined to hold the Indians responsible
for. He thought that perhaps they
collected them, in order to barter with
them among savage tribes when they went
home. Mr. Waddilove seemed to take
but a faint interest in these petty larcenies,
but humourously suggested that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_192" id="page_192">{192}</a></span>
they should employ some lady bicyclists
from Slater’s detective agency to see if
they could catch the thieves. That failing,
he suggested that they should try
chaining the scissors to the table or to
the looking-glass, after the manner of
Bibles in old churches. Close beside them
stood the Senior Wrangler of the last
year, talking Psychical Research with the
sub-organist of Trinity. An archdeacon,
who looked like a sheep that had gone
very badly astray, was turning over the
pages of Max Nordau’s <i>Degeneration</i>, and
close to him an undergraduate, with eyebrows
meeting over his nose and the
face of a truculent rabbit, was demonstrating
the absurdity of the Christian
Faith to two frightened Freshmen, who
seemed willing to agree to anything he
might suggest. As the Babe passed, he
heard the words “so-called Resurrection,”
and his smile grew a shade more seraphic.</p>

<p>The Babe wandered back to the outer
room, where the discussion on the standpoint
of determinism or some similar subject
was still proceeding shrilly. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_193" id="page_193">{193}</a></span>
Swotcham for the moment had the ear
of the house, and he was speaking rapidly
and excitedly in a sort of cracked
treble voice, and apparently endeavouring
to tie his fingers into hard knots.
They had been joined by three more disputants
whom the Babe conjectured to
be in the running for the Apostles, for
the other three evidently regarded them
as promising amateurs rather than professionals.</p>

<p>He made his way across to the window,
where he saw Mr. Stewart sitting
with a somewhat isolated air.</p>

<p>“This is a very interesting sight,
Babe,” he said, “and I was looking out
for someone to whom I could talk about
it. I feel a trifle like St. Anthony in the
desert, with all sorts of half-understood
temptations beckoning to me. On one
side I hear the siren voice of philosophy
calling me to leave the world, and live in
the realms of pure theory; on the other
side of the table stand three joyous Freshmen
in the heyday of youth and animal
spirits drinking whisky and water, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194" id="page_194">{194}</a></span>
fourth, with a temerity which I envy, a
curious pink liqueur; on the right you
may observe two members of the Footlights
Club, who are slaves, so they tell
each other, to their divine mistress, Art,
to whom they offer sacrificial burlesques
twice a year. An archdeacon, with the
face of a mediæval saint from a painted
glass window, has just gone through into
the next room, where he will hear a pupil
of mine preaching atheism&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I heard someone just now allude to
the ‘so-called Resurrection.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>“The chances are a thousand to one
that that was he,” said Stewart. “Just
behind you an Italian is singing the joys
of the back streets of Naples to two tuft-haired
absurdities, who are sighing to see
a little ‘life.’ Meantime, through the open
door I can hear our sub-organist playing
the overture to <i>Parsifal</i>. He thinks that
if he goes on long enough and plays loud
enough the conversation will get a little
lower. He is wrong. The louder he
plays, the louder will everybody talk. In
fact he is laying up for them all a store<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_195" id="page_195">{195}</a></span>
of sore throats to-morrow morning. And
our host, whose moral digestion most
surely resembles that of an ostrich, turns
from one to another, and is appropriate
to all. There was also a member of the
Upper House here just now, but he did
not stop. He had mistaken the character
of the entertainment and had come in
evening clothes like you, but unlike you
had brought his wife décolletée. His
entry was pompous, his exit precipitous.
As for you, I have long ceased to be surprised
at anything you do. But do tell
me why you are here?”</p>

<p>The Babe looked round appreciatively.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure. I came here
because I had been dining at the T.A.F.
in King’s.”</p>

<p>“Ah, purely antidotal,” said Mr. Stewart.</p>

<p>“Not consciously; and I stopped, I
suppose, because it amused me. Surely
that is a very good reason.”</p>

<p>“The best of reasons, my dear Babe.
And when it ceases to amuse you, you
will go away, and I will come with you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_196" id="page_196">{196}</a></span>
And I came because it was Sunday, and
here one can shake off the impression that
it is Sunday, though I don’t know why
one should be able to do so with such
conspicuous success as one does. Somehow
in my own rooms everything looks
different on Sunday and in consequence
they are hardly habitable. I suppose it is
the influence of heredity: the rooms are
accustomed to generations of dons who
always wear black coats on Sundays, and
have a cold lunch. Ah, here is the archdeacon.
I suppose he has been getting
his mind out of its Sunday clothes too.
Archdeacons are venerable, are they not?
How do you address them, ‘Your Veneration’
or ‘Your Venerance’? Your
uncle is a Dean, is he not, Babe? Don’t
you know?”</p>

<p>“I think it’s ‘Your Veneree,’<span class="lftspc">”</span> said
the Babe, “on the analogy of referee.
Look, he’s talking to the ‘so-called Resurrection.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>“Then he is probably learning a thing
or two,” said Mr. Stewart. “That young
man never comes to see me without in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197">{197}</a></span>structing
me on the whole duty of a tutor,
which appears to be, to do what one intolerable
undergraduate tells him. For
he is intolerable, neither more nor less.
I think I have never met a young man
who inspired me with a more searching
abhorrence.”</p>

<p>The Babe looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“I suppose I shall be gated if I don’t
go back to Trinity soon,” he said.</p>

<p>“It is not unlikely. I will come with
you. I am drunk with impressions, and
I want a little moral soda-water. As we
walk, Babe, you shall speak to me of
Rugby football, and drop kicks. That I
hope will restore my equilibrium. I understand
now why you play football;
hitherto it has been a mystery to me. It
must be very calming to the moral nature.
So tell me what a Punt is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">{198}</a></span>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Between</span> his own tripos work, which
he stuck to steadily and grimly, and found
by mere force of routine less disagreeable
than he expected, Rugby football, the
storm and stress of social duties, as he
called them&mdash;which meant dining out or
having people to dinner five nights out of
the seven&mdash;and constant rehearsals for
the Greek play, the Babe’s time was very
fully taken up. Furthermore, on Mr.
Gladstone’s principle, though otherwise
their principles had nothing in common,
he always slept for eight and a half hours
every night, and if, as often happened, he
did not go to bed till two, the hours of
the morning were somewhat curtailed.
The Babe, however, did not object to this,
as the morning seemed to him the really
disagreeable part of the day. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199">{199}</a></span>
something crude and raw about the air
until lunch-time, which made itself felt,
whatever one was doing. It was necessary
of course to get through the morning
in order to arrive at the afternoon,
but the shorter it was made the better,
and by breakfasting late and lunching
early one could make it very short indeed.</p>

<p>He worked at the Greek play with extraordinary
zeal and perseverance. The
happy band of directors had begun to see
that he knew more about acting than all
the rest of them put together, though one
had seen two hundred and thirty-seven
different French plays, mostly improper,
and the Babe was present throughout
every rehearsal, sitting in the stalls
when he was not on the stage himself,
and making suggestions whenever they
occurred to him. Mr. Mackay, the second
stage director, had very strong and
original ideas on the subject of Cassandra,
whom he made his special care, and
he had mapped out exceedingly carefully
the gestures, tones, postures, and faces
she was to make as the prophetic afflatus<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200">{200}</a></span>
gradually gained possession over her.
She was a tall young gentleman with a
most lovely girlish face, and about as
much knowledge of the dramatic art as
of the lunar theory. But Mackay was
indefatigable in coaching her. She was to
point down with both hands outstretched
on the word “blood”; she was to roll her
eyes and stare at the centre of the fourth
row of stalls at the word “Apollo”; she
was to make a noise in her throat resembling
gargling on the second “Alas”; she
was to stagger on the third, and palpitate
on the fourth. She was to gaze with agonised
questioning at the Ophicleide when
Clytemnestra told her she was mad, as if
to ask whether he too agreed with her,
and breathe as if she had just come to the
surface after a prolonged dive; and from
that point onwards she was to cast restraint
to the winds. She was mad; let
the audience know it. Mad people were
incoherent and throaty; what she said
was incoherent, let her mode of saying
it be as throaty as possible. She must
continually gargle, gurgle, mule, puke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201" id="page_201">{201}</a></span>
croak, creak, hoop, and hawk, and if then
she didn’t bring down the house, well,&mdash;the
fault was not hers.</p>

<p>Cassandra, who at any rate had a good
memory, and did blindly what she was
told to do, had just been through her part
with faultless accuracy, and was a little
hoarse after it, and no wonder. She had
screamed, croaked, gurgled, gargled with
pitiless precision, and on the last word she
uttered, her voice, by an entirely unrehearsed
effort, had cracked like a banjo
string in a hot room. Mackay thought
this particularly effective, and when he
heard it was unpremeditated, urged her to
practise it. He patted her on the back as
she came off, and implied that if she acted
like that in the performances, they would
be very helpful to Æschylus’s reputation.
The other two stage directors, it is true, had
intermittently indulged in unkind laughter
during the performance, but Cassandra
had not heard them, and if she had,
she would not have cared.</p>

<p>At the end of the rehearsal the Babe
stayed behind for a few moments to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202" id="page_202">{202}</a></span>
about his dress, and passing across the
stage again on his way out, found the
three stage directors like the King, the
Queen, and the Executioner in <i>Alice in
Wonderland</i> in hot discussion. Like Alice,
he was instantly appealed to by all three,
and asked to give his opinion about Cassandra.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to say exactly what
I think?” he asked.</p>

<p>“By all means,” said Mackay, confidently.</p>

<p>The Babe hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>“I haven’t criticised Cassandra at all,”
he said, “because I understood she was,
so to speak, preserved. Also she is rather
slow, and there would hardly be time for
her to learn her part in the way I should
suggest, and it would be a pity to confuse
her mind farther. But if you ask what I
think, she only reminds me of a strong
young lady battling for reason against
the clutches of delirium tremens.”</p>

<p>The stage director who had seen so
many French plays, smiled.</p>

<p>“I said drunk,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203" id="page_203">{203}</a></span></p>

<p>“Drunk, certainly, and also I think beset
by the black-beetle visions,” said the
Babe. “I daresay inspiration by Apollo
may be like that, but I am afraid to an
English audience it will suggest D. T.”</p>

<p>“I thought she was splendid this morning,”
said Mackay.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve told you what I think,”
said the Babe.</p>

<p>“What do you advise?”</p>

<p>“If there is time, I should advise her
to remodel herself a little. Not to choke
so much; she spits at me like a llama, you
know. Not to be so inspired. There is
too much saliva in her madness, I think.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” broke in Mackay,
“you miss the whole conception of the
part. She is mad, stark, staring mad.”</p>

<p>“I daresay I’m wrong,” said the Babe.</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause, broken
by Mackay who picked up his coat
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said he. “Take her in
hand yourselves. I must be going. We
rehearse again at five, I think.”</p>

<p>A moment’s silence followed and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204">{204}</a></span>
all looked at each other with the air of
detected conspirators.</p>

<p>“Will you help us?” asked Dr. Propert
at length of the Babe.</p>

<p>“Do you mean, will I coach Cassandra?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The Babe hesitated.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to interfere,” he said,
“but certainly there is room for improvement
in Cassandra. And I don’t want
Mackay to think I am meddling with
him. I would much sooner not.”</p>

<p>“I think Mackay wishes it,” said Propert,
“only he didn’t like saying so.”</p>

<p>The Babe shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I didn’t gather that from his manner,
but if you can assure me of it, I will do
my best with her.”</p>

<p>Dr. Propert heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Too many cooks spoil the broth,” he
said magnanimously. “We have too
many stage directors. We all of us really
want you to manage the whole thing.
Some one will say your part this afternoon&mdash;I
will myself&mdash;if you will take the
rehearsal alone. Besides, the architecture<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_205" id="page_205">{205}</a></span>
of the palace is all wrong, and I have
found a fifth century statue with sandals
on. There is a cast of it in the Museum,
and I must get it copied. We have our
hands too full.”</p>

<p>So that afternoon Dr. Propert read out
Clytemnestra’s part, and the two other
stage directors sat meekly in corners, and
busied themselves with sandals, and from
the centre of the stalls the Babe issued
his orders, while Dr. Propert read his part
in a fine sonorous voice and in a modern
Greek accent, which made the Iambic
lines, so said Mackay, who had made a
special study of ancient metres, sound
like minor Galliambics. Cassandra exhibited
mild surprise when the Babe
stopped her gurgling, and when he forbade
her to ogle the place where the
Ophicleide should be, she felt like an
unanchored ship, drifting helplessly about
among quicksands. So the Babe reserved
her for private instruction, and told Agamemnon
not to go like Agag.</p>

<p>There was only a fortnight more before
the performance, and the Babe worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_206" id="page_206">{206}</a></span>
like a horse, and like Hans Müller made
miracles. The casual visitor to his rooms
was likely to be confronted with a raging
prophetess or a credulous king, in front
of whom stood the Babe showing them
how to rage or how to express the extremes
of credulity. Dr. Propert found enough
to do in superintending the stage properties
and the second stage director became
a sort of benignant elderly Mercury to
the Babe. Mackay alone held slightly
aloof.</p>

<p>On the night of the first performance,
there was a thick, palpable atmosphere
of nerves abroad, like a London fog.
Agamemnon kept repeating his first line
over and over again and wiping his hands
on his himation, and tried to remember
that, whatever he did, he must not clear
his throat before he began to speak. The
calm and prosy Argive elders put by their
prosiness and became peppery; Dr. Propert
flew about with altar wreaths in his
hands, which he deposited carefully in safe
places and then forgot where he had put
them. Even the placid, moon-faced Cas<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_207" id="page_207">{207}</a></span>sandra
pricked her fingers violently with
her fifth-century brooch. As for the
watchman it was a serious matter for
doubt whether his shaking knees would
ever take him safely down his somewhat
ricketty watch-tower. The Babe alone,
on whom really the whole responsibility
as well as the heaviest part rested, towered
head and shoulders above the nervous
fog, and was absolutely his own silly self.
He caught up Agamemnon three minutes
before the curtain was to rise and tried to
induce him to dance a <i>pas de quatre</i> out
of the palace, and when Agamemnon
trembled so that there was imminent risk
of the sandals coming off, let alone dancing,
danced a <i>pas seul</i> himself. He set
Mr. Sykes upon the altar and crowned him
with roses. He said he couldn’t remember
a word of his part, and proposed to act
the execution of Mary Queen of Scots
instead or send the audience empty away.
He peeped through the spy-hole of the
curtain and said the conductor hadn’t
come, which sent Dr. Propert flying round
to see what had happened, whereas he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_208" id="page_208">{208}</a></span>
been in his place for ten minutes. In fact,
he crowded, as he said, into five minutes
of glorious life, the fatuities of years.
The effect of all this was that the rest of
the company were so completely taken up
with deploring his behaviour, that they
quite forgot to be nervous, which was precisely
the end which the Babe had in
view.</p>

<p>The performance rose to the level of
excellence, and Cassandra maintained it,
but Clytemnestra&mdash;&mdash;the pens of the
critics failed before Clytemnestra. They
couldn’t, they confessed, do her justice.
She was a creation, a revelation, an incarnation;
she was wonderful, marvellous,
stupendous, gorgeous, inimitable, irresistible,
unapproachable, inexplicable. She
held the mirror up to Nature, the κἁτοπτρον
up to art, and the <i>speculum</i> up to
drama&mdash;this was a little involved, and Dr.
Propert is responsible. A shaggy student
from Heidelberg who represented his university,
thought she was a woman, and,
heedless of Agamemnon’s doom, fell in
love with her on the spot, and was dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_209" id="page_209">{209}</a></span>posed
to take it as a personal insult that
the Babe was of the sex that Nature made
him. However, as marriage was out of
the question, he wrote an appreciative article
in the Heidelberg <i>Mittheilungen</i> on
Clytemnestrismos (made in Germany),
contrasting it with Agamemnonismos,
with a great deal about the standpoint of
the subjective Ego, in the presence of objective
archaism. She held the house,
she entranced the audience, she dominated
their imaginations; she tore away
the veil of realism from in front of idealism
(whatever that may mean); she gilded
Æschylus’s conception, and enriched his
execution. She was Clytemnestra. And
then they began all over again with variations.</p>

<p>Every night at the fall of the curtain,
the Babe was called back again and again,
every night the whole house rose at him
like one man, and the florist outside the
theatre must have realised a competence
for the rest of his days. It had been a
rather dull and uneventful term, the University
wanted something to go mad<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_210" id="page_210">{210}</a></span>
about, and stark staring mad it went. If
Cambridge had not been in a Christian
country, it would have had a Babe-cult on
the spot. His photograph, taken at the
great moment when he came out with
“murder beaming from every line of his
countenance” as the <i>Cambridge Daily
News</i> finely observed, and slowly wrung
his hands free of the blood that dripped
from them, was in half the shops in the
town. For the second time&mdash;a unique
distinction&mdash;he was in authority in the
“Granta,” and the <i>Cambridge Review</i> had
a long article entirely about him, beginning,
“It must surely have occurred to
any thoughtful critic.” Night after night
the cry of “Speech”&mdash;what could have
been less appropriate than that Clytemnestra
should make an English speech
after a Greek play?&mdash;went up from a
crowded house, and as regularly the Babe
bowed and smiled and shook his black-wigged
head, and gracefully declined.
Once&mdash;it was most indecorous and improper&mdash;he
went so far as to whistle to
Sykes who was always in attendance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_211" id="page_211">{211}</a></span>
made him bark, but otherwise the attempt
to get a speech from the Babe was as
unprofitable as trying to get water out of
a stone. And his performance was the
more remarkable in that he did not repeat
himself slavishly: acting was an instinct
with him, and each night he acted as his
mood prompted him. For instance, his
manner of entry after the murder, changed
every night. Once he stood at the palace
door quite silent for nearly a couple of
minutes, until Dr. Propert turned quite
pale with the thought that perhaps the
prompter might think that he wanted
prompting, and spoil the moment, wiping
his hands slowly, and smiling a ghastly
smile at the chorus; once he came out
quickly and threw the axe away from him
and plunged into his speech; once, and
an audible horror ran round the house as
he did it, he broke into the silence by a
mirthless laugh as he fondled the axe
with which he had done the deed, like a
mother nursing her child. In a word, he
made it clear, that Æschylus was a most
excellent dramatist, and that he was a
most excellent actor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212">{212}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were only three weeks more to
the end of the term, but as soon as the
play was over, the Babe at once settled
down again to his social and historical
duties. With December a hard frost had
set in, and football for a time was at a
standstill. But next to football as an
after lunch amusement, the Babe preferred
above everything else a warm
room, a large chair, and congenial company.
With these objects in view he
asked Reggie and Ealing to lunch with
him one day, and entirely refused to go
out afterwards. Reggie, who had a sort
of traditional notion that people always
went out after lunch, or else they were ill,
was overruled by the Babe, who sent his
gyp out to order muffins for tea, and drew
his chair close up to the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_213" id="page_213">{213}</a></span></p>

<p>“But it’s such a jolly day, Babe,” said
Reggie, who was only half persuaded.</p>

<p>The Babe looked out of the window
and shuddered.</p>

<p>“By that you mean that there is a horrid
smell of frost in the air, that the sun
looks like a copper plate, and that by
walking very fast and putting on woollen
gloves you can get completely warm, with
the exception of the end of your nose. I
hate woollen gloves, I hate walking fast,
and I hate the tip of my nose to be cold.
I avoid all these things by sitting by the
fire.”</p>

<p>“Fuggy brute.”</p>

<p>“About my being a brute,” said the
Babe, “there may be two opinions. But
fuggy, as you call it, I am. I confess it,
and I glory in it. At the same time I’m
no fuggier than you. If you had your
way you would go a nasty walk in order
to get fuggy. We both want to be fuggy,
and I merely adopt the easiest method of
becoming so. Dear Reggie, you are so
very English. You love taking the greatest
possible trouble to secure your object.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_214" id="page_214">{214}</a></span>
That is called the Sporting Instinct. Personally
I am not troubled with a sluggish
liver, but if I was I should take a pill.
That would not suit English people at all:
instead of taking a pill, they take exercise,
purely medicinally, and they always
adopt the most circuitous ways of taking
it. What can be a more elaborate method
of guarding against a sluggish liver than
spending three thousand pounds on building
a tennis court, which can only be
used by two people at a time?”</p>

<p>“What do you play Rugger for, then?”</p>

<p>“Why, because it is the most expeditious
way possible of getting exercise. You
concentrate into an hour the exercise you
couldn’t get under half a day if you went
a walk.”</p>

<p>“I have known you get keen about it,”
said Reggie. “Was that only because you
admired the expedition with which you
were getting exercise?”</p>

<p>The Babe yawned.</p>

<p>“We’ll change the subject,” he said.
“I’ve been asked to your Comby on the
6th. I don’t know why a college should<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">{215}</a></span>
celebrate the birthday of their founder
by making scurrilous rhymes about each
other, but I’m quite glad that they should,
and I have very kindly consented to
come.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, awfully,” said Ealing.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it. But really it’s a
very interesting point, as Longridge would
say. You all go to chapel, and they sing
‘Zadok the priest.’ Then you have a big
feed in Hall, and the whole college assembles
together, and they libel each other
in decasyllable couplets. Luckily there’s
no rhyme to Babe.”</p>

<p>“There are heaps,” said Reggie precipitously.</p>

<p>“I think none. Talking of Longridge,
he is supposed to be perfecting a plan
by which, as you walk up to your door
you tread on a spring, and the door flies
open. He says it is so tiresome to open
a door when your hands are full. And
his hands always are full.”</p>

<p>“It sounds very pleasant,” said Reggie.
“Has he tried it yet?”</p>

<p>“Only once. That time his door was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216" id="page_216">{216}</a></span>
already open, and when he trod on the
spring, it shut with, I believe, quite incredible
violence and knocked all his books
out of his hands, besides hurting him very
much and breaking his spectacles. You’d
think that would stop him? Not a bit.
He merely rose on the stepping-stone of
his dead self to higher things. It only
gave him another new idea. He is going
to have a second spring inside the door,
which, when trodden on will shut it again
after you. At least that’s what he means
to do, when he is fit to walk about again.
At present he is incapacitated. I went to
see him yesterday; his nose is in splints.
I am so glad I haven’t an ingenious
mind.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be Longridge’s bed-maker,
if I was paid for it.”</p>

<p>“Bed-makers are paid for it,” said the
Babe. “Besides, as he truly says, if you
can have a dumb waiter why not have a
dumb bed-maker made of some stronger
material?”</p>

<p>“He never said anything of the kind,
Babe,” said Ealing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_217" id="page_217">{217}</a></span></p>

<p>“My dear chap, he has said lots of
things of the kind. You force me to
contradict you. He hardly ever says
anything of any other kind.”</p>

<p>“Babe, will you or will you not come
out?” demanded Reggie.</p>

<p>“I will not come out. I’m not going to
spoil my tea by going for a horrid walk.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would listen to reason.”</p>

<p>The Babe murmured something inaudible
about there being no reason to
listen, but when pressed, confessed that
he had been reading the <i>Green Carnation</i>
and it had affected his brains.</p>

<p>But Reggie, following, as the Babe
said, “that blind instinct which makes us
Englishmen what we are”&mdash;he was taking
liberties with the remarks made by his
fellow-guest at the T.A.F.&mdash;insisted on
going out and taking Ealing with him,
though promising to come back for tea,
and the Babe was left to himself.</p>

<p>He was conscious of feeling a little flat,
now that the Greek play was over, and
he half wondered to himself what he had
done before it began, to get through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_218" id="page_218">{218}</a></span>
time. For instance, to-day it was barely
half-past three, he was not going to dine
till eight, and he had already done as
much work as he meant to do. He
thought bitterly that Dr. Watts had very
much overrated Satan’s powers of invention.
The upshot was that he fell asleep
and Reggie and Ealing returning an hour
later found him stewing contentedly in
front of the fire.</p>

<p>The Babe was rather cross at being
awakened, and he said they smelt horribly
frosty. Also he wished the door to be
shut, and he was very hungry. Why were
they so unkind, and what had he done
to deserve this? But the muffins came
before long, and the Babe recovered his
admirable serenity under the cheering
influence of most of them.</p>

<p>“And though your muffin,” he remarked,
“is said to destroy the coats of
the stomach, no such ill effects will be
experienced if the patient takes enough
of them. My only misgiving is that I
have not taken enough. And yet I have
taken all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219" id="page_219">{219}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“How much dinner do you suppose
you will be able to eat?” asked Reggie,
who was still gazing incredulously at the
empty dish which the Babe had put on the
table close to him.</p>

<p>“As much as Stewart will be kind
enough to give me. And his board is
usually plentifully spread. If he asks me
to dinner much oftener I shall feel
bound in common gratitude to tell him
the truth about my royal visitor in the
Long. I wish I’d had a photograph of
the group taken, Jack really looked too
splendid.”</p>

<p>“Jack has the makings of a comedian
about him,” said Reggie, “but just now
he’s very serious. There is an epidemic
of sapping abroad, but if it wasn’t sapping,
it would probably be influenza, so
we can’t complain. You’re touched with
it, Babe, and Jack’s got it badly. I went
to see him yesterday, and he was analysing
the second Punic war in a large square
note-book with notes on the Wasps at
the other end.”</p>

<p>“I know. And he was quite angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_220" id="page_220">{220}</a></span>
when I ventured to speak disrespectfully
of Hannibal. He called me a funny ass,
and implied that Hannibal was more than
a father to him. Also he has taken to
red ink which is one of the worst signs.
I went into his room in the dark one day
last week, and upset something. It
proved to be a stone bottle of red ink,
rather larger than a ginger-beer bottle
and quite full. Also the cork was out,
and after that there was no further need
for the cork. It would have been like
locking the stable door when the steed
was spilt&mdash;I mean, stolen. I pointed that
out to him, for it was surely consoling to
know that no more red ink could be spilt
in his rooms, unless he was rash enough
to buy some more, in which case, so to
speak, it would have been on his own
head, which would be worse than on the
carpet, but he only murmured, ‘Caius
Flaminius Secundus,’ and asked if I
was sitting on his classical dictionary.”</p>

<p>“And were you?”</p>

<p>“I think it turned out that he was.
So I called him a sap, and went away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_221" id="page_221">{221}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“I hate a sap,” said Reggie with a certain
dignity.</p>

<p>“We used to call a sap a groutbags at
my private school,” said Ealing.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what else you could call
them. I was a groutbags once myself.”</p>

<p>The Babe yawned.</p>

<p>“I feel rather futile,” he said. “I
wanted to be amused, and you fellows
would go for a walk. Let’s play ‘Kiss
in the slipper,’ or something.”</p>

<p>“I hear you played Van John till two
this morning,” said Reggie.</p>

<p>The Babe stopped in the middle of his
yawn.</p>

<p>“Yes, a little after two, I think. We
played Van John and other things. I
lost six pounds. Blow the expense. Do
you know Feltham of this college?”</p>

<p>“No, why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing. He was there, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“Nice chap?”</p>

<p>“Nothing particular. Oh, yes, quite
nice, I should think, but he went away<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_222" id="page_222">{222}</a></span>
as soon as we shut up playing. I hardly
know him&mdash;in fact I never met him before.
Hullo, it’s seven. I must go.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“Only to see a man I know, as the
Apostles say. Are either of you dining
with Stewart to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” said Reggie. “At eight,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Be punctual, because I’m so
hungry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_223" id="page_223">{223}</a></span>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> all his life for two years and a half
at Cambridge, and he had associated with
very many classes there, the Babe had
never come across any man whom he
would suspect of being capable of doing
that which necessitated his going to see
“the man” he knew on such an errand
as this, and he concluded rightly that
though such people no doubt occurred,
they were not to be looked for, with any
chance of finding them, at university
towns. His errand was not a pleasant
one, and it was far from being an easy
one, and when he knocked at Feltham’s
door a few minutes afterwards, he could
not have hazarded the vaguest guess as
to what manner of exit he would make.</p>

<p>The Babe was, unfortunately, strongly
possessed by the gambling instinct, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_224" id="page_224">{224}</a></span>
when the night before a friend of his had
come in after Hall, and proposed whist if
they could get a four, the Babe said that
if they were going to play cards, they
might as well play something more amusing
than whist, which seemed to him as
a peculiarly unexhilarating mode of enjoying
oneself, and which he regarded as
a practical application of unmixed mathematics.
If Broxton would raise two people
to play at something more biting than
whist, the Babe would raise two others.</p>

<p>The Babe raised his two without much
delay, but Broxton returned with only
one. However, he said he had met a
chap called Feltham, who, he knew,
played, and should he see whether he
could come?</p>

<p>The Babe would have played cards
with old Gooseberry himself, if he could
not get anyone else, so Broxton went off
to see whether Feltham would play, found
him in and willing, and they played Van
John for a while, until the Babe began to
yawn and complained he had only lost
three and six. Did they know Marmara,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_225" id="page_225">{225}</a></span>
which was indifferently called “Only-a-penny,”
chiefly because it dealt with sums
usually much larger than that.</p>

<p>Some of them, and among these was
Feltham, did know Marmara, and the
others were willing to learn it. So the
Babe, assuring them that no previous
knowledge was required, proceeded to
enlighten them. Everyone placed a small
sum, say sixpence, or its equivalent in
counters, in the pool, and the dealer
thereupon dealt three cards face downwards
all around, and three to himself.
He then turned up the next card, and
you had all your premises.</p>

<p>Thus&mdash;if, for instance, the card turned
up happened to be a four of diamonds,
each player in turn had to bet, before
looking at his three cards which lay face
downwards on the table, whether they
contained a diamond higher than the four.
His stake was only limited by the sum
in the pool unless they chose to fix a
smaller limit. Thus with the four turned
up, it would probably appear to each
player that there was a fair chance of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_226" id="page_226">{226}</a></span>
holding a higher card of the same suit,
and he would in all likelihood stake pretty
well as high as he could. He would then
turn up his cards, and if his hand held a
diamond higher than the four, he would
have the pleasure of taking the amount of
his stake out of the pool, if not, the pain
of paying into the pool the same sum.</p>

<p>The game, so said the Babe, was amusing,
owing to the fact that it was pure
hazard, and also because the pool mounted
up in a way that would seem to the uninitiated
simply incredible. An example of
this occurred at the fifth deal. At the
beginning of this deal the pool contained
four shillings. The Babe dealt, and
turned up the two of spades. The first
player naturally enough went the pool,
but his hand very curiously contained
only diamonds, and he paid four shillings
into the pool, thus raising it to eight.
Even more naturally, since the first player
had held no spades, the second player
again staked the pool. His hand contained
two hearts and a club, and the
pool became sixteen shillings. It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_227" id="page_227">{227}</a></span>
have been midsummer madness in the
third player, who was Broxton, not to
stake the pool, and as it was November
and he was perfectly sane, he did so. His
hand revealed three splendid hearts, and
the pool rose to thirty-two shillings. The
chances were thus enormously in favour
of the fourth player clearing the pool, and
he accordingly staked it. But as he held
a diamond and two clubs, he paid the
pool the equivalent of thirty-two shillings,
in mean bone counters, belonging to the
Babe. There was nothing left for the
fifth player, who was Feltham, to do but
to stake the pool, which he did. His
hand, oddly enough, contained the seven,
eight, and nine of clubs, and he remarked
quite unreasonably, as he paid sixty-four
shillings into the pool, that the cards had
not been shuffled. Thus the Babe, who
had dealt, had a pool of sixty-four shillings
to win or lose. He staked the pool,
but he held one diamond, one club, and
the ace of spades, which counted below
the two, and he wrote an I O U for
sixty-four shillings, as he had not got<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_228" id="page_228">{228}</a></span>
enough counters, and paid it into the
pool, remarking that this was better than
whist at three penny points. Then the
pool in one deal had mounted from four
shillings, to one hundred and twenty-eight
shillings, and it was obvious that if a similar
deal occurred again now, there would
be a very considerable sum in the pool at
the end of it.</p>

<p>The Babe in these matters was, like
the Athenians, somewhat superstitious,
and he said cheerfully that it was a mounting
pool, and they would have some
amusement. The pool showed by its
subsequent conduct that he was right,
and at the end of an hour it held about
£50, about half of which had been contributed
by Feltham, whose luck had been
abominable. This, as they were playing
at present, might be won by anybody,
since there was no limit to the stakes, and
the Babe, with the best possible motives,
since he was the only one present who
would not be somewhat embarrassed by
the total loss of his contribution to the
pool, proposed setting a limit, of, say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_229" id="page_229">{229}</a></span>
twenty-five shillings to the stake. Feltham
objected strongly, and the alteration
was vetoed.</p>

<p>Everyone, with the exception perhaps
of the Babe, was a little excited and on
edge, for when two or three are gathered
together to gamble they often generate
spontaneously between them&mdash;this is a
sober fact&mdash;a little demon which hovers
about and unsettles their nerves. Feltham
especially hardly spoke, except to
name his stake, and sometimes to swear
when he lost it, and the Babe felt that
they were all taking it too seriously and
quite spoiling his pleasure. For himself,
he liked a “little game” because it happened
to amuse him, but the others were
behaving as if they cared whether they
won money or lost money, and this, to
the Babe’s thinking, spoilt the whole
thing. The point of gambling, according
to him, was not whether you won
money or lost money, but the moment
when it was uncertain whether you were
going to win (in the abstract) or lose
(in the abstract). The view is wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_230" id="page_230">{230}</a></span>
unreasonable, and so is the gambling
instinct.</p>

<p>It was Broxton’s turn to deal. He
dealt badly, holding the pack from which
he dealt nearly a foot above the table,
so that if any of them happened to be
looking at the cards as they were dealt to
him, the chances were that he would get
a glimpse or a hint of what the under one
was, and once before that evening the
Babe had demanded a fresh deal, because
as his cards were dealt him, he could not
help seeing the corner of a picture card.
This time, however, he was handing a
cigarette to Feltham, who sat on his
right. But as Feltham’s cards were dealt
him the Babe saw him look up quickly,
and he himself saw the face of one of
them, so far, at least, that he would have
been ready to swear it was a picture card
in clubs. Feltham at the moment seemed
to him to open his mouth to speak, but
said nothing and only glanced hurriedly
at the Babe, who did not look at him
again during the game. The turn-up
card was the nine of clubs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_231" id="page_231">{231}</a></span></p>

<p>The first two players naturally enough,
as there were only four cards out of fifty-two
which could beat the nine, staked a
nominal stake merely, and turned up their
cards. One of them held the king of
clubs, and this would have won, leaving
only three cards in the pack which could
win. He took a shilling, the amount of
his stake, out of the pool, and said he
wished he had trusted to his instinct. It
was Feltham’s turn. He staked £20,
which was madness. His hand contained
the queen of clubs and he won.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Very soon after, the Babe renewed his
proposition that they should limit the
stakes, and this time there was no opposition,
and as it was already after one,
they settled to stop as soon as the pool
had been emptied. The pool, seeing
them change their tactics, also changed
its own, and instead of mounting continued
to sink steadily. Every now and
then it would go up again by a couple of
limit stakes, but the constant tendency
was to sink, and in three-quarters of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_232" id="page_232">{232}</a></span>
hour it was empty. Broxton gathered
up the cards and counters, and Feltham
and two of the others said “Good-night,”
and left the room, but Anstruther and the
Babe sat down and waited. The Babe
helped himself to whisky, tore up his
own I O U’s which he had paid for, and
there was a long awkward silence.</p>

<p>Broxton got up, closed the door, and
came and stood in front of the fire.</p>

<p>“That fellow cheated,” he said at last.
“I saw him, twice. Did you notice,
Babe?”</p>

<p>“I thought he saw the cards which
were dealt him once. The turn-up was
a nine of clubs and he staked £20. It
struck me as unusual, particularly as the
king was already out.”</p>

<p>“Then he cheated twice, as Jim said,”
answered Anstruther. “I am convinced
he saw his cards once before, both times
when Jim was dealing.”</p>

<p>“Jim, you damned fool,” said the
Babe, “why can’t you manage to deal
properly?”</p>

<p>“We’re all damned fools, I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_233" id="page_233">{233}</a></span>”
said Broxton. “What business have we
got to ask a fellow to play whom we don’t
know, and who probably can’t afford it.”</p>

<p>“Nor can I,” said Anstruther, “but I
don’t cheat.”</p>

<p>“Are we quite sure he did cheat?”
asked the Babe.</p>

<p>“Personally, I am,” said Broxton,
“aren’t you, Anstruther?”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s to be done?” asked the
Babe.</p>

<p>“The men who play with him ought to
know,” said Anstruther.</p>

<p>The Babe got up, and threw his torn-up
I O U’s into the fire.</p>

<p>“Rot,” he said. “We can’t possibly
be certain. And I’m not going to ask
him to play again in order to watch him.
That seems to me perhaps one degree
lower than cheating oneself. It’s our
own fault, as Jim said, for asking him.”</p>

<p>“My dear Babe, we can’t leave it as it
is.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want to do that. I only
meant that we couldn’t tell other people<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_234" id="page_234">{234}</a></span>
what we suspected, unless we were certain,
and not even then. And we can’t
be certain unless we play with him again,
and that I don’t mean to do.”</p>

<p>“What <i>do</i> you propose to do then?”</p>

<p>“I propose that one of us tells him
what we thought we saw.”</p>

<p>“And if he denies it?”</p>

<p>“The matter ends there. At the same
time to make it clear to him that three
people separately thought they saw him.”</p>

<p>“Thought they saw him!” said Broxton.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Thought they saw him.
I daresay he isn’t a bad chap. I daresay
he was playing for far more than he could
afford. It is even possible he will confess
he did cheat, and it is quite possible that
we are all wrong and that he didn’t.
Personally I certainly thought he did, but
I wouldn’t take my oath on it.”</p>

<p>“Who’s to ask him?”</p>

<p>There was a short silence. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>“I will, if you like,” said the Babe.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Babe,” said Jim, “you’d do
it better than either of us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_235" id="page_235">{235}</a></span>”</p>

<p>The Babe lit a cigarette, and finished
his whisky.</p>

<p>“I’m off to bed,” he said, “I would
sooner have played ‘old maid’ than that
this should have happened. Of course
none of us say a word about it? Good-night,
you chaps.”</p>

<p>Anstruther and Broxton sat on for a
bit after the Babe had gone.</p>

<p>“It’s a devilish business,” said the latter
at length. “But I’m sure the Babe
will manage it as well as it can be managed.”</p>

<p>“The Babe isn’t half a bad chap,” said
Anstruther.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think he is. In fact, I
don’t think I ever knew a better. Are you
off? Good-night.”</p>

<p>The Babe wrote a note to Feltham
next morning asking him if he would be
in at seven that evening, and receiving an
affirmative answer, it thus came about
that he tapped at his door at that hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236">{236}</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Qui s’accuse, s’excuse.<br /></span>
<span class="i6"><span class="smcap">From the French.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Babe’s supposition that Feltham
“perhaps wasn’t a bad chap” was perfectly
correct. At the same time it is
perfectly true that he had cheated at cards,
which, quite rightly, is one of the few
social crimes for which a man is ostracised.</p>

<p>He had cheated, and he knew it, and
he was thoroughly, honestly, and unreservedly
ashamed of it. He did not try to
console himself by the fact that he had
never done it before, and by the knowledge
that he would never do it again,
because he knew that he would fail to
find the slightest consolation in that,
though it was perfectly true. The thing
was done and it was past mending. Twice
he had seen the cards, or at any rate had
a suspicion of one of them, when they
were dealt him, without saying anything.
On one of these occasions what he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237">{237}</a></span>
seen did not help him, for he saw only
a card of another suit, but once, when he
had seen the queen of clubs, he traded on
it, and swindled the company of £20.</p>

<p>How he had come to do it, he did not
know. He thought the devil must have
taken possession of him, and he was
probably quite right. The temptation
was the stronger because he had lost, as
the Babe had suggested, much more than
he could afford, and the thing was done
almost before he meant to do it. He
more than half suspected that the Babe
had noticed it, but to do him justice this
suspicion weighed very light in his mind,
compared with the fact that he had
cheated.</p>

<p>Next morning the Babe’s note came,
and his suspicion that the Babe had
noticed it took definite form. It was no
manner of use refusing to see him, but
what he could not make up his mind
about, was what answer he should give
him. To confess it would not help him
to make reparation, and to return, as he
honestly wanted to do, the £20 he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238">{238}</a></span>
won and besides it did not seem, in anticipation,
particularly an easy thing to do.
And when the Babe knocked at his door,
he was still as much in the dark as ever,
as to what, if the Babe’s errand was what
he suspected, he should say to him.</p>

<p>The Babe accepted a cigarette, and sat
down rather elaborately. He had determined
not to remark upon the weather or
the prospects of an early dissolution, or
make any foolish attempts to lead up to
the subject, and after a moment he spoke.</p>

<p>“I am awfully sorry,” he said, “to have
to say what I am going to. In two words
it is this: Three men with whom you
were playing last night at Marmara,
thought that once or twice you saw your
cards, or one of your cards, before you
staked. I am one of them myself, and
we decided that the only fair and proper
thing to do was to ask you whether this
was so. I am very sorry to have to say
this.”</p>

<p>The Babe behaved like the gentleman
he was, and instead of looking at Feltham
to see whether his face indicated anything,
kept his eyes steadily away from him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_239" id="page_239">{239}</a></span></p>

<p>Feltham stood a moment without answering
and if the Babe had chosen to
look at him he would have seen that he
paused because he could not command his
voice. But the Babe did not choose to do
so. Feltham would have given anything
that moment to have been able to say “It
is true,” but it seemed to him a physical impossibility.
On the other hand he felt it
equally impossible to take the high line,
to threaten to kick the Babe out of the
room unless he went in double quick time
etc., etc.,&mdash;to do any of those things which
thorough-paced swindlers are supposed to
do when their honour is quite properly
called in question.</p>

<p>“It is a damned lie,” he said at length,
quite quietly and without conviction.</p>

<p>The Babe got up at once, and stepped
across to where Feltham was standing.</p>

<p>“Then I wish to apologise most sincerely
both for myself and the other two
fellows,” he said, “and if you would like
to knock me down, you may. I shall of
course tell them at once we were mistaken,
and I believe what you say entirely.
Will you shake hands?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_240" id="page_240">{240}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Feltham let the Babe take his hand,
and as the latter turned to leave the room,
sat limply down in the chair from which
the Babe had got up.</p>

<p>But the Babe had hardly got half-way
across the room, when Feltham spoke
again.</p>

<p>The Babe’s utter frankness had suddenly
made it impossible for Feltham to
let him go without telling him, but to tell
him now was not made easier by having
lied about it.</p>

<p>“Please wait a minute,” he said.</p>

<p>The Babe’s cigarette had gone out, and
he lit it again over the lamp. Then he
sat down in the window seat and waited.
Outside, the grass was sparkling with frost
and the clock chimed a quarter past seven.
Simultaneously Feltham spoke:</p>

<p>“I have lied to you as well,” he said.
“What you saw was perfectly true. I
cheated twice, at least I saw one of the
cards dealt me twice, and said nothing
about it. Once the card happened to be
immaterial, and once I staked £20 knowing
I should win. I have told you all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_241" id="page_241">{241}</a></span>”</p>

<p>The Babe was a person of infinite variety,
and if those who knew him best had
seen him now, they would hardly have believed
it was he. He sat down on the
arm of the chair where Feltham was sitting,
and to himself cursed the whole pack
of cards from ace to king, and above all
Jim Broxton. Then aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>“My poor dear fellow,” he said. “I’m
devilish sorry for you.”</p>

<p>Feltham, who had been expecting to
hear a few biting remarks or else merely
the door slam behind the Babe, looked
up. The Babe was looking at him, quite
kindly, quite naturally, as if he was condoling
with him on some misfortune.</p>

<p>Feltham began, “Damn it all&mdash;” then
stopped, and without a moment’s warning
burst out crying.</p>

<p>The Babe got up, went to the door and
sported it. Then he sat down again on
the arm of the chair.</p>

<p>“Poor chap,” he said. “It’s beastly
hard lines, and I fully expect it’s as much
our fault as yours. You needn’t trouble
to tell me you never did it before: of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_242" id="page_242">{242}</a></span>
course you didn’t. I fully believe that.
People who would confess that sort of
thing don’t do that sort of thing twice.
It was like this perhaps&mdash;we were playing
for far more than you could afford, and
you didn’t mean to do it, until somehow
it was done. Money is a devilish contrivance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was just like that,” said Feltham.
“As I told you, the first time I
saw a card, it didn’t make any difference,
though of course I ought to have said so.
But the second time it did, and before I
knew what I had done, I had cheated.
Why don’t you call me a swindler and
tell me I’m not fit to associate with gentlemen?
It’s God’s truth.”</p>

<p>The corners of the Babe’s mouth
twitched.</p>

<p>“It’s not my concern then. What
would be the good of saying that?”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, hoping that
Feltham would make a certain suggestion,
and he was not disappointed.</p>

<p>“Look here, there’s the twenty pounds:
what can I do with it? Can you help me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243">{243}</a></span>”</p>

<p>The Babe thought a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes, give it me. I’ll see that the
other fellows get it somehow, if you’ll
leave it to my discretion. And, you know,
it sounds absurd for a fool like me to give
advice, but if I were you I shouldn’t play
cards for money again. It’s no use running
one’s head into danger. If it’s not
rude, what is your allowance?”</p>

<p>“Two hundred and fifty.”</p>

<p>“You bally ass! Yet I don’t know.
It’s our fault. You couldn’t tell that
the pool would behave in that manner,
and I know, personally, I should find it
out of the question to say one was playing
for more than one could afford. Some
people call it moral cowardice, it seems to
me a perfectly natural reticence.”</p>

<p>“Of course I won’t play again,” said
Feltham. “Why have you been so awfully
good to me?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t. What else was I to do?
Oh, yes, and I think I respected you for
telling the truth. Most fellows would
have lied like George Washington.”</p>

<p>Feltham smiled feebly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_244" id="page_244">{244}</a></span></p>

<p>“All that remains is this,” said the
Babe. “Of course I must tell those other
two fellows about it, the two I mean with
whom I talked, but you can trust them
absolutely. It is impossible that anyone
else should ever know about it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think&mdash;oughtn’t I to tell
them all?” stammered Feltham.</p>

<p>The Babe frowned.</p>

<p>“Of course you ought not. Why the
deuce should you? About the money&mdash;it
must be divided up between us all.
Six into twenty, about three pound ten
each. Rather an awkward sum.”</p>

<p>“Why six?”</p>

<p>“Because there were six of us.”</p>

<p>“I can’t take any.”</p>

<p>“Your feelings have nothing to do
with it,” remarked the Babe. “The
money in the pool of course belongs to
everyone. You return the others’ shares
of that £20 and keep your own. Well,
I’ll manage it somehow. I will make
absurd bets, seventy to one in shillings.
That will surprise nobody: I often do it.
Good Lord, it’s a quarter to eight. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_245" id="page_245">{245}</a></span>
you’re going into Hall, you’ll be very
late, and so shall I for my dinner. I
must go. Oh, by the way, did you lose
much altogether?”</p>

<p>“About twenty-five pounds.”</p>

<p>“Is it, is it”&mdash;began the Babe. “I
mean, are you in a hole? If so, I wish
you’d let me lend you some money.
Why shouldn’t you? No? Are you
sure you don’t want some? It’s no use
receiving unpleasant letters from one’s
father, when there’s no need. Well as
you like. Good-night. Come round and
look me up some time: I’m on the next
stair-case.”</p>

<p>Feltham followed him to the door.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you what I feel,” he said
huskily, “but I am not ungrateful. Half
an hour ago you asked me to shake hands
with you. Will you shake hands with
me?”</p>

<p>“Why, surely,” said the Babe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_246" id="page_246">{246}</a></span></p>

much relieved in mind. Now that it was
over he confessed to himself that he had
been quite certain that Feltham had
cheated, but that he should own up to it,

himself totally devoid of anything which

<p class="nind">affair from his mind, as a puppy shakes
itself after being in the water.</p>

<p>He was, naturally, late for dinner, and
Mr. Stewart who knew the value of soup
and also the habits of the Babe, had not
waited. When he did appear, he was, of
course, perfectly unabashed, and took the
bottom of the table with unassuming grace.</p>

<p>“The psychology of punctuality,” he
remarked, “is a most interesting study.
Some day I mean to study it, and I
shall write a little monograph on the
subject uniform with those which Sherlock
Holmes wrote on tobacco ash and
the tails of cart horses. I think there
must be a punctuality bacillus, something
like a death-watch, always ticking,
and if there isn’t one, I shall invent it.
It doesn’t take to me. I am too healthy.”</p>

<p>“My dear Babe,” said the Stewart,
“you have disappointed me. I always
hoped that you were the one person I
have been looking for so long, who has
never been punctual; But you have
been punctual to my knowledge twice,
once on an occasion in the Long<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_248" id="page_248">{248}</a></span>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“When was that?” interrupted the
Babe. “I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“On a memorable occasion. At lunch
in your own rooms.”</p>

<p>The Babe caught Reggie’s eye, and
looked away.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“And as Clytemnestra, you always
killed Agamemnon with ruthless punctuality.
I was always hoping to hear him
scream during the next Chorus but one.”</p>

<p>“I did the screaming for him,” said the
Babe complacently, “except on the first
night. He could only scream like an
empty syphon.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing more tragic or blood-curdling
than the scream of an empty
syphon,” said Stewart. “It shrieks to
you, like a banshee of all the whisky and
soda you have drunk. The only thing
that could shriek worse would be an empty
whisky bottle, and that can’t shriek at all.
If he really could scream like that, you
robbed him of a chance of greatness by
screaming for him, although you screamed
very well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_249" id="page_249">{249}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“There are syphons and syphons,” said
the Babe, “he screamed like an empty
but undervitalised one, which had never
really been full.”</p>

<p>“Babe, if you talk about undervitalised
syphons during fish,” said Reggie, “you
will drive us all mad, before the end of
dinner.”</p>

<p>“Going mad,” said Mr. Stewart, “is an
effort of will. I could go mad in a minute
if I wished, and the Babe certainly
determined to go mad when he was yet a
boy. No offence meant, Babe. I can confidently
state that during the three years
I have known him, he has never for a
moment seemed to be really sane.”</p>

<p>“I was perfectly sane when I settled
to go in for the tripos,” said the Babe.</p>

<p>“You never settled to do anything of
the kind. You think you did and it
is one of your wildest delusions.”</p>

<p>“Secondly I was sane,” said the Babe,
“when I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No you weren’t,” put in Reggie.</p>

<p>“Reggie, don’t be like Longridge.
But you are quite right. I wasn’t sane<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_250" id="page_250">{250}</a></span>
then, though I thought I was for the moment.”</p>

<p>“Longridge is better, though he still
has a large piece of sticking plaster over
his nose,” said Mr. Stewart. “He came to
see me to-day. He insisted on arguing
with me in spite of my expostulations.
When he talks, I always want to cover
him up, as one covers up a chirping
canary.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would do it some day.
With a piece of green baize you know,
and a hole in it where the handle of the
cage comes out.”</p>

<p>“He would continue to make confused
noises within,” said Reggie.</p>

<p>“He always makes confused noises,”
said Mr. Stewart wearily. “Confused,
ingenious, noises. Babe, tell me if that
champagne is drinkable.”</p>

<p>The Babe drank off his glass.</p>

<p>“Obviously,” he said. “But it’s no
use asking me: all champagne seems to
me delicious. I drink Miller’s cheapest
for choice.”</p>

<p>A small withered don who was sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_251" id="page_251">{251}</a></span>
next the Babe, and had not previously
spoken, here looked up.</p>

<p>“A nice, dry, light wine,” he said.</p>

<p>The Babe started violently, and if he
had not just emptied his glass of champagne,
he would certainly have spilled it.
He explained afterwards that he really
had forgotten that anyone was occupying
the chair on the right.</p>

<p>This curious old gentlemen, one of the
few surviving specimens of this particular
type of elderly don had the classical name
of Moffat, and Mr. Stewart at once introduced
him to the Babe, a ceremony which
had escaped his memory before, and Mr.
Moffat who had been shivering on the
brink of conversation all dinner, decided
to plunge in.</p>

<p>“I saw your performance of the <i>Agamemnon</i>
last week,” he said.</p>

<p>“I hope you enjoyed it,” said the Babe
politely.</p>

<p>“The stage is not what it was in me
young days,” said Mr. Moffat.</p>

<p>The Babe looked interested and waited
for further criticisms, but the old gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_252" id="page_252">{252}</a></span>man
returned to his dinner without offering
any. His face looked as if it was
made of cast iron, painted with Aspinall’s
buff-coloured enamel.</p>

<p>There was a short silence, and Mr.
Stewart, looking up, saw that the Babe
was fighting like a man against an inward
convulsion of laughter. His face changed
from pink to red, and a vein stood out on
his usually unwrinkled brow. Stewart
knew that when the Babe had a fit of the
giggles it was, so to speak, no laughing
matter, and he made things worse by asking
Mr. Moffat how his sister was. At
this point the Babe left the room with a
rapid, uneven step, and he was heard to
plunge violently into the dishes outside.
Stewart had been particularly unfortunate
in his choice of a subject, because what
had started the Babe off, was the very
thought that Mr. Moffat’s sister was no
doubt the original Miss Moffat, and he had
been rashly indulging in wild conjectures as
to what would happen if he said suddenly:</p>

<p>“I believe your sister doesn’t like
spiders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_253" id="page_253">{253}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Mr. Moffat had resumed the subject
of the Greek play when the Babe returned&mdash;he
seemed not to have noticed his ill-mannered
exit&mdash;and was finding fault with
the chorus, particularly with the leader,
who, in the person of Reggie, was sitting
opposite him. Of this, however, he had
not the slightest idea.</p>

<p>“I call them a dowdy crew,” he said.
“They were dressed like old baize doors.
Not me idea of a chorus at all. But it
was all very creditable, very creditable
indeed, and we have to thank me young
friend here for a very fine performance of
Clytemnestra. Why, me sister”&mdash;here
the Babe gasped for a moment like a
drowning man, but recovered himself
bravely&mdash;“me sister came down next
morning at breakfast, and said she’d
hardly been able to sleep a wink, hardly
a wink, for thinking of Clytemnestra.”</p>

<p>The Babe made a violent effort and
checked himself.</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry,” he said, with his most
engaging manner. “I hope you will
apologise to her for me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_254" id="page_254">{254}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Not at all, not at all,” said Mr. Moffat.
“It’s me own opinion she slept far more
than she knew. But she was always nervous,”&mdash;the
Babe bit his tongue&mdash;“easily
upset. A very good pheasant, Mr. Stewart,
a very good pheasant. Thank ye,
yes, a glass of champagne. A glass of
wine with you, heh, heh, Clytemnestra.”</p>

<p>Mr. Moffat, as the Babe allowed afterwards,
was a very pleasant old gentleman.
When dinner was over and he had settled
himself into an arm-chair by the fire,
smoking one of Stewart’s strongest cigars,
he told several stories about the old generation
of dons whom he had known.</p>

<p>“There was an old fellow of King’s”
he was saying, “in me undergraduate
days, who must have been eighty, and
never a night had he spent out of Cambridge
since he came up as an undergraduate.
An infidel old lot he was.
Many a time I’ve seen him in the evening,
when the worms were come out on
the grass plot, hobbling about and trying
to kill them with the point of his
stick. He used to talk to them and make<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_255" id="page_255">{255}</a></span>
faces at them and say, ‘Ah, damn you.
You haven’t got me yet.’ A queer lot
they all were, not the worms I mean, heh,
heh, but the old dons. There were two
others who had been great mathematicians
in their time, and they used to spend
their evenings together doing, what do
you think? Making paper boats, sir,
which they went and sailed on the Cam
next day. They would start them from
the King’s bridge, and sail them down
to the willow at the other end of the
lawn. And such quarrels as they had
over which had won! One of them one
morning, his name was Jenkinson, if I’m
not mistaken, an old Yorkshireman, got
so heated over it,&mdash;for he said the other
boat had fouled his, as if they were racing
for a cup,&mdash;that he went for the other
man, by gad, sir, he went for him, and
tried to push him into the river. But the
other&mdash;his name was Keggs&mdash;was too
quick for him, and stepped out of the
way, and head over ears into the river
went Jenkinson himself, being unable to
stop himself, sir, by reason of the impetus<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_256" id="page_256">{256}</a></span>
he had got up. The river isn’t over deep,
there, as you know, perhaps two feet deep,
and he stood up as soon as he could find
his feet and bawled out: ‘Ah misdoot
ye’ve drooned me, Keggs.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>The Babe was delighted.</p>

<p>“Do tell me some more,” he said, when
Mr. Moffat had finished laughing himself,
which he did in a silent, internal manner.</p>

<p>“Ah, some of those old fellows did
things not quite fit for boys to hear about.
<i>Maxima reverentia</i>, eh, Mr. Stewart? But
there was an Irishman, a fellow of Clare
too, in my time. I might tell you about
him; he used to live in the rooms above
the gate. He had a quarrel with the
Master, and as often as the Master went
in and out of the gate, egad, the old chap
would try to spit on his head. If the
Master was out to dinner, he would wait
up, sitting in his window till he came
back, be it eleven o’clock or twelve, or
later than that. At last the Master had
to put up an umbrella when he walked
under the gate of his own college and
then the old fellow would shout out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_257" id="page_257">{257}</a></span>
‘Come, out o’ that, ye ould divil, and
let me get at ye.’ A disreputable old
crew they were!&mdash;Ah well, it’s half-past
ten. Eleven’s me bedtime, and I must
be going. Good-night to you Mr. Stewart,
and many thanks for your kind hospitality.
And good-night to you, sir,” he
said turning to the Babe; “I heard them
shout ‘Clytemnestra, good old Clytemnestra,’
after you all down the street. And
you deserved an ovation, sir, you richly
deserved an ovation, and I’m glad you
got it.”</p>

<p>After Mr. Moffat’s departure, they settled
down again, and Stewart remarked:</p>

<p>“You’ve made a conquest, Babe. But
you behaved abominably during dinner.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it. I could think of
nothing but Miss Moffat. On the top
of that you enquired about his sister. I
ask you, what was I to do?”</p>

<p>“You needn’t have danced in the dishes
outside,” said Reggie.</p>

<p>“I only danced in the soup, and we’d
finished with the soup. And there’s a
soupçon of it on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_258" id="page_258">{258}</a></span>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shut up.”</p>

<p>“Pumps,” continued the Babe. “May
I have some whisky? Thanks. For
what I’m going to receive. What a
funny undergraduate Moffat must have
been.”</p>

<p>“I believe he was born like that,” said
Stewart. “I know when I came up, ten
years ago, he was just the same. That’s
the best of getting old early: you don’t
change any more.”</p>

<p>“That’s one for you, Babe,” remarked
Reggie.</p>

<p>“The Babe is the imperishable child,”
said Stewart.</p>

<p>“You called me a man of the world
the other day,” said the Babe in self-defence.</p>

<p>“I think not.”</p>

<p>“You did really. However, we’ll pass
it over.”</p>

<p>“By the way, Babe, you are corrupting
the youth of the college. Two men
went into their lodgings last night at ten
minutes past two. It transpired that they
had been playing cards with you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_259" id="page_259">{259}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Well, it is true that I was playing
cards last night. But they could have
gone away earlier if they had wished.”</p>

<p>“Your fascinations were probably too
strong,” said Reggie.</p>

<p>“Now you’re being personal, and possibly
sarcastic,” said the Babe with dignity.
“I must go to bed. I was late last
night.”</p>

<p>“The night is yet young, Babe,” said
Stewart.</p>

<p>“So am I. But if I don’t go, I shall
continue to drink whisky and soda, and
smoke.”</p>

<p>“You are welcome. How is the tripos
work progressing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s getting on,” said the Babe,
hopefully. “A little at a time, you know,
but often. I’m not one of those people
who can work five hours at a stretch.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not. Is it to be a second
or a third?”</p>

<p>“I believe there are three classes in
the tripos,” said the Babe stiffly. “You
have only mentioned two. Well, yes,
perhaps one of your small cigarettes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_260" id="page_260">{260}</a></span>
would not hurt me. But I must go at
eleven, because I am sapping. Oh, isn’t
that the <i>Shop Girl</i> on the table? There
are some awfully good songs in it. May
I go and get my banjo?”</p>

<p>“Do. I got it expressly for you to
sing.”</p>

<p>The Babe slept his usual eight and a
half hours that night. He did not awake
till 10.30.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_261" id="page_261">{261}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> frost continued, black and clean,
and the Babe, like the Polar Bear, thought
it would be nice to practise skating. He
bought himself a pair of Dowler blades
with Mount Charles fittings, which he
was assured by an enthusiastic friend were
the only skates with which it was possible
to preserve one’s self-respect, and fondly
hoped that self-respect was a synonym
for balance. Hitherto his accomplishments
in this particular line had been
limited to what is popularly known as
a little outside edge, but Reggie who
was a first-rate skater undertook his education.
The Babe, however, refused to
leave his work altogether alone, for he
was beginning to be seriously touched
with the sapping epidemic, and he and
Reggie used to set off about one, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_262" id="page_262">{262}</a></span>
lunch with them, to the skating club, of
which Reggie was a member, and of
which the Babe was not.</p>

<p>Sykes only went with them once, and
he would not have gone then, had it been
possible to foresee that he would put
skates in the same category as croquet
balls and bathers, but it was soon clear
that he did. He made a bee-line for the
unemployed leg of Professor Robertson,
who was conscious of having done the
counter rocking turn for the first time in
his life without the semblance of a scrape,
and brought him down like a rabbit shot
through the head. The Babe hurried
across to the assistance of the disabled
scientist, and dragged Sykes away. But
Sykes had his principles, and as he dared
not use threats to the Babe, he implored,
almost commanded him not to put on
his skates.</p>

<p>“Sykes, dear, you are a little unreasonable,”
said the Babe pacifically.
“Reggie, what are we to do with Sykes?
There was nearly one scientist the less in
this naughty world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_263" id="page_263">{263}</a></span>”</p>

<p>The cab in which they had driven up,
was still waiting, and at Reggie’s suggestion
Sykes was put inside and driven back
to the stable where he slept.</p>

<p>The Babe wobbled industriously about,
trying to skate large, and not deceive himself
into thinking that a three was finished
as soon as he had made the turn, and
Reggie practised by himself round an
orange, waiting for a four to be made up,
until the Babe ate it.</p>

<p>About the third day the Babe was
hopelessly down with the skating fever,
which went badly with the sapping epidemic.
He took his skates round to
King’s in the evening, after skating all
day, for the sapping epidemic was rapidly
fleeing from him like a beautiful dream at
the awakening, and skated on the fountain;
he slid about his carpet trying to
get his pose right; he put his looking-glass
on the floor and corrected the position
of the unemployed foot; he traced
grapevines with a fork on the tablecloth
and loops with wineglasses; he dreamed
that he covered a pond with alternate<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_264" id="page_264">{264}</a></span>
brackets and rocking turns, and woke up
to find it was not true; he even watered
the pavement outside his rooms in order
to get a little piece of ice big enough for
a turn, with the only result that the bed-maker,
coming in next morning, fell
heavily over it, barking her elbow, and
breaking the greater part of the china she
was carrying, which, as the Babe said, was
happily not his. Unfortunately, however,
the porter discovered it, as he brought
round letters, and ruthlessly spread salt
thickly over it, while the baffled Babe
looked angrily on from the window.</p>

<p>Snow fell after this, and the Babe proposed
tobogganing down Market Hill.
He talked it over with Reggie, and they
quarrelled as to which was the top of the
hill and which the bottom, “for it would
never do,” said the scrupulous Babe, “to
be seen tobogganing up hill,” and on referring
the matter to a third person, it was
decided that the hill was perfectly level,
so that they were both right and both
wrong, whichever way you chose to look
at the question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_265" id="page_265">{265}</a></span></p>

<p>The King’s Comby (which is an abbreviation
for Combination and means Junior
Combination Room, but takes place in
quite a different apartment) went off satisfactorily.
The Babe, secure in the knowledge
that there was no rhyme to Babe in
the English language (his other name,
which I have omitted to mention before,
was Arbuthnot, and it would require an
excess of ingenuity to find a rhyme even
to that), made scurrilous allusions, most
of them quite unfounded, about his friends,
in vile decasyllables, and enjoyed himself
very much. Later in the evening he with
two of the performers in the original play
acted a short skit on the <i>Agamemnon</i>, in
which he parodied himself with the most
ruthlessly realistic accuracy, and killed
Agamemnon in a sponging tin with the
aid of a landing net and a pair of scissors.
Last of all he disgraced himself by stamping
out in the snow, in enormous letters,
the initials of a popular and widely known
don of the college, with such thoroughness,
that the grass has never grown since,
and the initials are to be seen to this day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_266" id="page_266">{266}</a></span>
to witness if I lie. The proceedings terminated
about three in the morning, and
the Babe was left waiting for some minutes
outside the porter’s lodge at Trinity, while
that indignant official got out of bed to
open the gate to him.</p>

<p>The Babe ought to have caught a bad
cold, but with an indefensible miscarriage
of justice, it was the porter who caught
cold, and not he, and the Babe observed
cynically, when he heard of it, that the
memory of the dog in the nursery rhyme,
that bit a man from Islington in the leg,
and then died itself, had at last been
avenged.</p>

<p>Christmas, the Babe announced, fell
early that year, and consequently he with
several others stayed up till Christmas
Eve, when they were allowed to stay no
longer. He had gone up to town for two
days to play in the University Rugby
match, which he had been largely instrumental
in winning, for the ground was like
a buttered ballroom floor, a state of
things which the Babe for some occult
reason delighted in, and for an hou<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_267" id="page_267">{267}</a></span>r’s
space he proceeded to slip and slide and
gloom and glance in a way that seemed to
paralyse his opponents, and resulted in
Cambridge winning by two tries and a
dropped goal. The dropped goal was the
Babe’s doing: theoretically it had been
impossible, for he appeared to drop it out
of the middle of a scrimmage, but it
counted just the same, and he had also
secured one of the tries. The <i>Sportsman</i>
for December 15th gives a full account
of the match; also the Babe’s portrait, in
which he looks like a cross between a
forger and a parricide.</p>

<p>On returning to Cambridge, in order to
be up to date, he and some friends went
out carol-singing one night, visiting the
heads of colleges, and the houses of the
married fellows. The Babe acted as showman
and spoke broad Somersetshire, which
interested a certain philologist, who had
no suspicion that they were not town people,
very much. The Babe declared that
his father and grandfather had lived in
Barnwell all their lives, and that he himself
had never even attempted to set foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_268" id="page_268">{268}</a></span>
out of Cambridgeshire except once on the
August Bank Holiday, when he had intended
to go to Hunstanton but had missed
the train. At this point, however, the
philologist winked and said: “Mr. Arbuthnot,
I believe.” They collected in all
seventeen shillings and eightpence, which
they settled should be given to a local
charity, but the Babe, as he counted the
amount over with trembling, avaricious
fingers, looked up with a brilliant smile as
he announced the total and exclaimed:
“Not a penny of that shall the poor ever
see.” They also got what Rudyard Kipling
calls “lashings of beer” at several
houses, and Bill Sykes who had been
coached to carry a small tin into which
offerings of money were put by the open-handed
householder, was without a shadow
of reason filled with so uncontrollable a
fit of rage at the sight of the cook at one
of the houses in Selwyn Gardens, who
patted him on the head, and called him a
pretty dear, that he dropped the tin mug,
and nipped her shrewdly in the parts about
the ankle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_269" id="page_269">{269}</a></span></p>

<p>Reggie parted from the Babe at the
station, the latter going to London, and
Reggie to Lincolnshire. The Babe travelled
first because he said Sykes refused
to go second or third, but that intelligent
animal, poking his nose out from under
the seat just as the guard was taking the
tickets, was ignominiously hauled out, and
compelled to go in the van, which cannot
be considered as a class at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_270" id="page_270">{270}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Marsden</span> stopped for a moment
under the Babe’s window and called</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p>Ba&nbsp;-&nbsp;abe</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">and the Babe’s face looked out vindictively.</p>

<p>“If you call me like that I sha’n’t
answer,” he said. “You’re not in Clare.”</p>

<p>So Jack went in, and found the Babe
curled up again in a large chair, close to
the fire, working. The month was February,
which is equivalent, at Cambridge,
to saying that it was raining&mdash;cold, sleety,
impossible rain. As the exact day of the
month was the sixteenth, it followed as a
corollary that it had been raining for at
least sixteen days, and, as it was leap year,
it would continue to rain thirteen more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_271" id="page_271">{271}</a></span></p>

<p>“Well?” said the Babe unencouragingly.
He had gone to bed early the
night before, and the consequent length
of the morning made him rather cross.</p>

<p>“Oh nothing. It’s raining, you know.
The <i>Sportsman</i> says that Jupiter Pluvius
is in the ascendant still.”</p>

<div class="poetry2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“He sends the snow in summer,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">quoted the Babe.</p>

<p>“Just so, and he doesn’t neglect to
send the rain in February. I’ve just
come back from King’s. Reggie’s in a
bad temper, almost as bad as you.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Weather, chiefly. He says it would
be grovelling flattery to call it beastly.”</p>

<p>“Reggie is given to making truisms,”
said the Babe turning over the page.
“Jack, I wish you’d go away. I want to
work. Besides, you’re so devilish cheerful,
and I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Sorry to hear it. Oh, yes, and Reggie<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_272" id="page_272">{272}</a></span>
told me to remind you that you are playing
tennis with him at twelve. He’s got
the New Court.”</p>

<p>The Babe brightened up: there was an
hour less of morning.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! that will suit me excellently.
Many thanks, and please go away. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Stewart confessed that the Babe had surprised
him. Most people who knew the
Babe were never surprised at him, because
they always expected him to do something
unexpected. But no one had ever supposed
that he would do anything so unexpected
as to work steadily every day. It
would not have been so surprising if he
had worked twelve hours a day twice a
week, but that he should work four hours
every day, upset all preconceived ideas
about him. He had done so for a full
month, and really there seemed no reason
now why he should stop. He got up before
nine, and he worked from ten till one:
at one he would be himself again till six,
but he would work from six till seven.
Stewart considered this exhibition as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_273" id="page_273">{273}</a></span>
striking imitation by Nature of Mr. R. L.
Stevenson’s Jekyll and Hyde: he had not
clearly realised before that the Babe had
a dual nature. Just now he considered
Hyde to be painfully predominant, for
that the Babe should cease being absurd
for four hours a day seemed to him a
sacrifice of the best possibilities of his
nature.</p>

<p>But the Babe, like Mr. Gladstone in
one thing more, threw off all thoughts of
such matters, except during work hours,
and having determined to put in an extra
hour in the afternoon, to make up for tennis
in the morning, he trotted off through
the dripping, drizzling rain to the tennis
court in the best of spirits.</p>

<p>He went back to lunch with Reggie
in King’s Hall and as, contrary to all
precedent, the rain had stopped, they went
for a walk afterwards round two or three
football grounds, to see what was going
on, and give Mr. Sykes an airing. Scratch
games seemed the order of the day, and
they “took situations” on outside wings
opposite each other for a few minutes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_274" id="page_274">{274}</a></span>
the game on the King’s ground, until Reggie
charged the Babe and knocked him
down, after which they retired, dirty, but
invigorated. Then they turned into the
tennis court again for a while, and so by
Burrell’s Walk across the town bridge, and
back into Trinity Street, looked in at the
shop windows, which are perhaps less alluring
than any others in the kingdom, and
admired the preparations for diverting the
sewerage of the town from the Cam.</p>

<p>“But how,” said the Babe, “our college
boats will be able to row in a perfectly
empty river bed, is more than I feel fit to
tell you.”</p>

<p>“They’ll keep up the water by shutting
the locks,” said Reggie, vaguely.</p>

<p>“But no shutting of locks, Reggie, will
ever repair the drought caused by the cessation
of the drains. There’s the Master
of Trinity. Take off your hat: he won’t
see you. I really wish Sykes wouldn’t
always smell Masters of colleges. It
makes them nervous; they think indirectly
that it’s my fault. Bill, you idiot, come
here!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_275" id="page_275">{275}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Bill having come to the conclusion that
there were not sufficient grounds to warrant
the Master’s arrest, reluctantly dismissed
the case, though he would have
liked bail, and trotted after the Babe.
The latter had just discovered that life
was not worth living without a minimum
thermometer which he saw in a chemist’s
window, and had to go and buy it.</p>

<p>They passed up to the left of Whewell’s
Court, by the churchyard without a church,
and into Jesus Lane in order to deposit
Sykes again at his stables, and then, as
tea-time was approaching, turned back
towards Trinity.</p>

<p>“And for our tea,” said the Babe, “we
will go to the Pitt, where it may be had
cheaply and comfortably, and we can read
the telegrams, which as far as I have observed,
deal exclusively with steeplechase
races, and the state of the money market.
I noticed that money was easier yesterday.
I am so glad. It has been terribly
difficult lately. But if it is easier, no
doubt the financial crisis between me and
my father, which I expect at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_276" id="page_276">{276}</a></span>
this term, will be more capable of adjustment.
At present I fear my creditors
will find me like moist sugar, fourpence
the pound. Do you suppose there are any
races going on at Newmarket? We
might drive over: I feel as if a little carriage
exercise would do me good. Here’s
Jim. Jim always knows about races. He
was born, I mean dropped, at Esher. Jim,
is there any racing going on at Newmarket?
Why do you look so disgusted?”</p>

<p>“It’s so likely that flat races should be
going on now,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it can’t be helped,” said the
Babe. “What nice brown boots you’ve
got. Have you been out on your gee-gee?”</p>

<p>“Looks rather like it.”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” said the Babe. “We’re
going to have tea. Do you know Reggie?
Jim, Reggie, Reggie, Jim.”</p>

<p>“Met before,” said Jim. “Ta, ta, Babe.
I’ve got a coach at four.”</p>

<p>The Babe according to custom weighed
and measured himself, found as usual that
no change had taken place since yesterday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_277" id="page_277">{277}</a></span>
put his hat on the head of the bust of Pitt,
whence it clattered on to the floor, let the
door into the smoking room swing to in
Reggie’s face, and ordered tea. A group
of three or four men before the fire were
talking about someone called Pocohantas,
who turned out on enquiry to be a horse,
and the Babe expressed himself willing to
lay current odds about anything in the
world.</p>

<p>He and Reggie strolled back in the
dusk, and parted at the gate of Trinity.
The Babe went to work till Hall, and after
Hall played picquet with Anstruther,
whom he fleeced, capotting him once and
repiquing him twice in an hour, and discussed
with him the extraordinary dulness
of the Lent term, and the impossibility of
making it any livelier.</p>

<p>“It’s a sort of close time,” said the
Babe, “for things of interest. I don’t
know why it should be so, but every day
is exactly like every other day, and they
are all dull. I feel eclipsed all the Lent
term. I make a show of gaiety, but it is
all hollow. I suppose really one does de<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_278" id="page_278">{278}</a></span>pend
a good deal on things like cricket
and football, and fine weather. One
doesn’t know it at the time, but one
misses them when they are not there.”</p>

<p>“You’ve taken to sapping: you oughtn’t
to mind.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary I mind all the more.
When I’ve done a morning’s work, I come
out fizzing with being corked up so long,
and nothing happens to my fizz. It loses
itself in the empty and infinite air.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be poetical, Babe.”</p>

<p>“For instance,” continued the Babe,
“what am I to do now? I’ve had enough
picquet, and I’ve got nothing to say, and
I’ve worked enough, and I don’t want to
go to bed.”</p>

<p>“All right, don’t go to bed. Sit and
talk to me.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to talk,” said the
Babe volubly. “There’s nothing to talk
about. I’ve played tennis, I’ve worked,
I’ve taken Sykes for a walk, and that’s all.
Really one must be extraordinarily clever
to be able to talk day after day all one’s
life. How does one do it? <i>A priori</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_279" id="page_279">{279}</a></span>
one would expect to have said all the
things one has got to say by the time one
was twenty, and I’m twenty-one. Yet
I am not dumb yet. One doesn’t talk
about things that happen, and most people,
and I am one myself, never think at
all, so they can’t talk about what they are
thinking about. Give me some whisky
and soda; perhaps, as Mulvaney says, it
will put a thought into me. I hate Mulvaney
worse than I hate Learoyd, and that
is worse than I hate Ortheris. As for Mrs.
Hawksbee, that’s another story. Soda is
like a solution of pin points. It pricks
one all over the mouth. I wonder if it
would do as well to put ordinary pins into
water. I shall ask Longridge what he
thinks about it. Now he’s an exception,
he does nothing but think; you can hear
the machinery clicking inside him. He
thinks about all the ingenious things he’s
going to do and all the ingenious things
nobody else would think of doing. They
don’t come off mostly, because the door
hits him in the face, or the gum won’t
stick. Thanks. When! Do you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_280" id="page_280">{280}</a></span>
Stewart is beginning to think I shall get
through the tripos, and he warned me not
to work too much. He says that I shall,
by all precedents in such matters, get
brain fever and consumption, and that my
sorrowing friends will kneel round my expiring
bedside&mdash;you see what I mean&mdash;on
the morning the tripos lists are announced
and shout out above the increasing clamour
of my death rattle, ‘You are Senior Historian,’
and that my reform from the wild
young spark to the pale emaciated student,
will all date from one evening last year
at the Savoy, when he said he would only
take the longest odds if he had to bet on
my getting through.”</p>

<p>“And did you give him long odds?”</p>

<p>“No: I wouldn’t have bet against myself
even then, for the simple reason that
one never knows how much one can
try until one has tried. If you don’t believe
in yourself, nobody will believe in
you. Not that I do believe in myself for
a moment, any more than I believe in, in
anybody else. You see, six months ago I
shouldn’t have believed it possible that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_281" id="page_281">{281}</a></span>
should work steadily four hours or more a
day. I think I shall take to spectacles,
and go for grinds on the Grantchester
road; I believe that’s the <i>chic</i> thing to do
in sapping circles. Fancy waking up some
morning to find oneself in a sapping circle.
I wonder what Saps think about.”</p>

<p>“Sap, probably. Oh, yes, certainly sap.
Either Thucydides, or binomial theories,
or is it theorems or aortas. Babe, let us
meditate on aortas for a time.”</p>

<p>“By all means. I wonder what an aorta
is. Yes, thanks, but only a mouthful, as
Reggie says. That’s because he has such
a big mouth. I say, I wish I had an object
in life: it must be so interesting.”</p>

<p>“Liver,” said Anstruther brutally, “take
a pill. What do you want an object in
life for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. It would be something
to play about with, when one didn’t
want to talk or see other people. I suppose
a conscience would do as well. I
haven’t either.”</p>

<p>“You said ten minutes ago that you
didn’t want to talk. Since then I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_282" id="page_282">{282}</a></span>
only been able to get in an occasional
word edgewise.”</p>

<p>The Babe laughed, and finished his
whisky.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m very sorry. It’s a great
misfortune not to be able to be silent.
It’s not my fault. I sha’n’t take a pill; I
shall go to bed instead. I always used to
think that ‘the grave as little as my bed’
was an independent sentence and meant
literally what it said. Not that it meant
much. Do you ever lie awake?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not: I can understand
the difficulty of keeping awake, but not of
going to sleep.”</p>

<p>“I lay awake nearly five minutes last
night,” said the Babe, “and so I thought
I was going to be ill! But I wasn’t, at
least not at present. I suppose people
who lie awake, think.”</p>

<p>“I always fancied they only swore.”</p>

<p>“In that case there would be nothing
gained. I’m getting silly. Good-night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_283" id="page_283">{283}</a></span>”</p>

to convince him that he was hopelessly
and completely at the mercy of the
winds and waters, like Danaë, the mother
of Perseus, in her wooden chest, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_284" id="page_284">{284}</a></span>
his destiny was no longer in his own hands.
As then, there was nothing whatever to be
done, he did nothing in serene content.
He would soon bump against the arches
of Clare Bridge, but until that happened
there was no step he could possibly take.</p>

<p>It was just three days before his tripos began,
and the Babe, with a wisdom beyond
his years, was taking three complete holidays.
He argued that as it already seemed
to him that his brain was one turbid mass
of undigested facts and dates, the best
thing he could do was not to swallow more,
but to let what he had settle down a little.
For a fortnight before he had been working
really hard, going over the ground
again, and for the next three days he
meant neither to think nor do anything
whatever. As he expressed it himself
after last Sunday morning chapel, “I am
going,” he said “to eat and sleep and do
and be simply that which pleases me.”</p>

<p>He was roused by a loud injured voice
not far off shouting, “Look ahead, sir,”
and he sat up. His boat, as is the ineradicable
habit of Canadian canoes, had drifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_285" id="page_285">{285}</a></span>
broadside across the river and was fouling
the course of an outrigger which was
wanting to come up.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” shouted the Babe,
“but I’ve lost my paddle. Hallo, Feltham,
is that you?”</p>

<p>“It’s me, Babe. What can I do for
you, and what do you mean by fouling
my waterway? Where is your paddle?”</p>

<p>The Babe looked round.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s up there on the bank, by the
King’s Bridge. Can’t I catch hold of the
tail of your boat, then you might tow me
up there?”</p>

<p>“All right, but don’t call it a tail, as
some rowing man will hear you and have a
fit. Let me get clear. Are you slacking,
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and for the next two days. My
tripos begins on Monday, and I think
that if I do nothing for a day or two I
may be able to remember again who the
Electric Sophia was.”</p>

<p>“Is she important? She sounds as if
she might be the wife of the man who discovered
lightning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_286" id="page_286">{286}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Don’t confuse me further,” said the
Babe. “Where are you off to?”</p>

<p>“Oh, up the river. There’s no cricket
to-day.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that people who played
cricket ever rowed.”</p>

<p>“They don’t for the most part: but I
don’t consider that a reason for not doing
so if I wish.”</p>

<p>“Are you playing for the ‘Varsity on
Monday?”</p>

<p>“They have been polite enough to ask
me.”</p>

<p>“And you have very civilly consented.
Well, good-bye.”</p>

<p>The Babe sat in his canoe for half an
hour or more, and got through a little
<i>Ravenshoe</i>, and a little meditation. The
meditation concerned itself chiefly with
Feltham, who, as was universally acknowledged,
was the best of good fellows, quiet,
steady, thoroughbred. And these things
gave the Babe some pleasure not ill-deserved,
to think over, for Feltham had
been known primarily as a friend of his.
And when he was tired of meditating he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_287" id="page_287">{287}</a></span>
tied up his canoe again and walked up to
the King’s field, for his college was playing
King’s and he was certain of finding
company, whichever side was in. It turned
out that King’s was in that enviable position,
and of King’s, Reggie and a careful
little man in spectacles. Reggie could
not by the most partial of his friends be
called a cricketer, but the most impartial
of his enemies would have had to confess
that he often made a great many runs.
He had a good eye, he saw the ball and
he helped it to fulfil its destiny by hitting
it hard. More particularly did he hit
balls on the off which ought to be left
alone, and he always hit them high in the
air over long slip’s head. It really did
not seem to matter where long slip was
placed, for he always hit the ball over his
head, and out of reach. Straight balls he
subjected to a curious but very vigorous
mowing process, which took them swiftly
past the umpire’s nose. A straight yorker
invariably got him out, if he knew it was
a yorker and tried to play it, so that when
he saw one coming he held his bat per<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_288" id="page_288">{288}</a></span>fectly
firm and rigid and quenched it,
but if it did not occur to him that the
ball was a yorker he treated it with cheerful
contempt and hit it somewhere, which
surprised no one more than himself. It
seemed to be the recognised thing that
he should be given three lives as at
pool, and, as at pool, if he used them
up quickly, he was frequently allowed to
star, and have two more. A sort of extra
square leg, specially designed for his undoing,
had just given him his fourth life
when the Babe appeared, and Reggie
scored three runs over it. The field luckily
could be arranged solely with a view
to catching him, for the careful little man
in spectacles only scored singles, and those
by hitting balls with extreme caution just
out of reach of cover-point.</p>

<p>The Babe enjoyed watching cricket, especially
the sort of game that was going
on now. One bowler was extremely fast,
the other incredibly slow, and Reggie hit
them both in the air with perfect impartiality,
and the careful little man played
them both with as much precision and
delicacy, as if he was playing spillikins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_289" id="page_289">{289}</a></span></p>

<p>However, a few overs later, though his
own score was small, he did Reggie, and
so, indirectly his side, a signal service.
The latter had hit a fast ball almost quite
straight up in the air and extremely high,
and they both started on a forlorn run.
Point and wicket-keep both ran to it, and
the careful little man charged violently in
between them exactly at the crucial moment,
as they were both standing in front
of his wickets, with the result that out of
the midst of chaotic confusion the ball fell
innocuously to the ground. The careful
little man went to the pavilion for a new
pair of spectacles after being given “not
out” for obstructing the field, which he
certainly had been doing, and point and
wicket-keep cursed him and each other,
and Reggie thanked them all.</p>

<p>This was the last ball of the over, so
Reggie still had the bowling. The slow
bowler prepared for him a ball with an
immeasurable break from the off upon it,
but Reggie very wisely danced gaily out
onto the middle of the pitch, turned
straight round and hit it so severe a blow
that the wicket-keep in whose direction it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_290" id="page_290">{290}</a></span>
was travelling had only just time to get
out of the way. It narrowly missed Reggie’s
own wicket, but a miss is as good as
four runs when it is hit hard enough, and
this one was.</p>

<p>But the service he often did his side,
and was doing now, could not be fairly
measured merely by the runs he scored,
for the demoralising effect he always had
on the field was worth fifty extra. After
a certain number of catches have been
missed, and a large number of balls hit
high in the air just out of reach of a field,
a side begins unconsciously to think “Kismet”
and withal to grow discontented, and
a side that thinks “Kismet” is lost.</p>

<p>Reggie was out seventh wicket down,
having made sixty-two, and as there was
only another half-hour to the drawing of
stumps, he left the game, and walked
down with the Babe. They were going
to dine together and go to the theatre to
see a touring <i>Mrs. Tanqueray</i>. To the
Babe’s great delight the “theatrical tuft-hair”
was in great force, and between the
acts he wandered about in the passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_291" id="page_291">{291}</a></span>
listening rapturously to the fragments of
their conversation.</p>

<p>There was one in particular, who had
sat next the Babe, markedly worthy of
study. His gown was about eighteen inches
long, and his cap, out of which he
had carefully abstracted every particle of
board, drooped gracefully at all its corners.
He was in dress clothes with a
smoking coat (not in a Norfolk jacket,)
and he wore a large diamond solitaire,
and a red cummerbund. He was evidently
a king among his kind, and several
of them crowded round him as he came
out between the acts and admired him.
They called him “Johnny,” and he called
them “Johnny” individually, and “Johnnies”
collectively, and the Babe listened
to them with a seraphic expression of face.</p>

<p>“Arfly parful, isn’t it? I say, Johnny,
give me a light.”</p>

<p>“Old Redfarn’s put up a notice about
not smoking in the passage. I shall rag
him about it.”</p>

<p>“That gurl’s pretty good, isn’t she?
Looks rather nice too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_292" id="page_292">{292}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“You’re quite mashed on her, old chappie.
But she’s not a patch on Mrs. Pat.”</p>

<p>“Johnny can’t think of anything but
Mrs. Pat. I say, let’s go and have a
drink.”</p>

<p>“All right. Johnny stands drinks. The
gurl at the bar’s an awful clipper.”</p>

<p>“Johnny will drop his pipe and get her
to pick it up for him.”</p>

<p>“Well, come on, you Johnnies. There’s
only ten minutes. Keep an eye on
Johnny.”</p>

<p>The Babe’s eye followed them as they
walked off to the bar, with rapturous
enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they heavenly?” said he to
Reggie. “Oh, I wish I was like that!
It must be so nice to feel that one is the
light and leading of the whole place and
really knows what life is. I wish I knew
what life was. I wonder how they get
their hair to stick out like that. How I
have wasted my time! I too might have
been a Johnny by now, if I’d cultivated
them. Reggie, do come to the bar: I
want to gaze and gaze on them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_293" id="page_293">{293}</a></span>”</p>

<p>But Reggie refused: he said they made
him sick, and the Babe told him that he
regarded things from the wrong standpoint.</p>

<p>“You know,” said the Babe, “they’ve
persuaded each other that they are the
very devils of fellows. They really
believe it. What a thing it is to have
faith. They will talk quite fluently to
the barmaid. I remember so well trying
to see whether I could. I couldn’t: I
knew I couldn’t all the time. I have
never felt so hopelessly bored in so few
minutes. They think it’s wicked; and
they think that they rag their tutors.
The poor tutors are men of no perception,
for they haven’t the least idea they
are being ragged. There they all come
again. Their faces shine with deviltry.
Did you hear them talk about Mrs. Pat?
They meant Mrs. Patrick Campbell you
know&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re no better, Babe,” said Reggie,
“you used to want people to think you
wicked.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but that’s quite different. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_294" id="page_294">{294}</a></span>
can’t say that I was ever the least like a
Johnny. I never had the courage. Fancy
being as brave as they are, and oh, fancy
deliberately sitting down and taking all
the stuffing out of your cap in order to
be a blood!”</p>

<p>“I’ll take yours out, if you’ll take
mine, Babe. There’s the bell. We must
go in again.”</p>

<p>The Babe went to see Stewart when
he went back to Trinity. The latter
thoroughly approved of his holiday.</p>

<p>“You are giving yourself a little space,”
he said, “in which it may be hoped you
will forget, or rather assimilate, a few of
the useless and ugly things which our
system of examinations has compelled
you to learn. A historian is not a person
who knows masses of facts and dates,
but a man who has built a structure upon
them. The facts are the scaffold, which
disappears when the house is built. And
the tripos turns out a quantity of promising
young men who can only build scaffolds.
I wish I was examining. There
should be no questions with dates in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_295" id="page_295">{295}</a></span>
them, and they should all begin “Trace
the tendency,” or “Indicate in a great
many words the influence.”</p>

<p>“I wish I felt more certain about my
scaffold.”</p>

<p>“My dear Babe, don’t vex your soul.
Possess it in peace. I would give long
odds on your getting through. What I
did not expect was that you should have
taken the distasteful steps that lead to so
immaterial a result. You got a second
in your last May’s didn’t you? Do let us
talk of something a little more interesting
than triposes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t introduce the subject,”
said the Babe.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing this evening?”</p>

<p>“I’ve just been to the <i>Second Mrs.
Tanqueray</i> with Reggie.”</p>

<p>“An interesting medical case,” remarked
Stewart. “I believe the author
consulted an eminent nerve doctor, as to
how many months’ living with Aubrey
Tanqueray would drive an excitable
female to suicide. He thought six, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_296" id="page_296">{296}</a></span>
as the author wished her to do it in less,
he had to introduce other incentives.
Aubrey Tanqueray would drive me to
madness in a week, and to suicide in
eight days. He handed her toast at the
scene at breakfast, as if he was giving her
a slice of some cardinal virtue with the
blessing of the Pope spread on it like
butter. The real <i>motif</i> of the play,
though the British public haven’t known
it, is her growing despair at being wedded
to him, and the immediate cause is the
<i>Second Mr. Tanqueray’s</i> noble forgiveness
of her when she was found to have
tampered with the letter bag. He treated
her like a candidate for confirmation,
instead of boxing her ears, and said that
the incident only served to draw them
closer together, or something of the kind.
Apparently if you commit a sufficiently
mean action towards a person who really
loves you, he will be delighted, and love
you the more for it. It sounds a little
Jesuitical, baldly stated. Who wrote the
play? Pinero wasn’t it. Pinero is obviously
the future from ‘Pinsum,’ I am a pin.”</p>

<p>The Babe laughed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_297" id="page_297">{297}</a></span></p>

<p>“I didn’t attend to the play much,” he
said. “There was an undergraduate
sitting next me, who was more interesting.
He wore a red cummerbund.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” murmured Mr. Stewart.
“The kind that talks to the female in
tobacconists’ shops, and sits on the counter
as it does so. Its father is usually one of
nature’s gentlemen, who has married a
perfect lady. The two always marry each
other, and in the next generation the females
dress in Liberty fabric, and the males
congregate at the smaller colleges. They
are on the increase. I suppose it’s an instance
of the survival of the filthiest.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stewart rose from his chair, and
crossed over to the window-seat where
the Babe was sitting.</p>

<p>“What can I do to amuse you, Babe?”
he said. “I feel that it is the duty of all
your friends to distract your thoughts from
all subjects for the next two days. Shall
I play cards with you&mdash;you shall teach me&mdash;or
shall we talk about the Epsom meeting,
or the A.D.C.? I suppose you are
going to act in the May week? Why not
act <i>Hamlet</i>, and we will persuade Long<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_298" id="page_298">{298}</a></span>ridge
to be Ophelia. There is something
sublimely inconsequent in the way Ophelia
distributes artificial flowers to the company
which reminds me of Longridge in
his soberer moments. I have been very
much tried by Longridge to-night. He
asked me to help him to sing glees in the
Roundabout. Can you imagine Longridge
and me sitting side by side in the
Roundabout singing “Three Blind Mice?”
I could imagine it so vividly that I didn’t
go.”</p>

<p>The Babe laughed.</p>

<p>“You can give me whisky and soda,
and then I shall go to bed. It is twelve,
and I must practise being dressed and
breakfasted by nine. Does it require
much practice?”</p>

<p>“I should think about twenty minutes
every morning. What is the use of doing
a thing you have got to do, before you
have got to do it? It is like cutting
yourself with a knife to accustom yourself
to a surgical operation.”</p>

<p>“There are points of similarity,” said
the Babe. “I shall go to bed now for all
that, as soon as I’ve drunk this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_299" id="page_299">{299}</a></span>”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Babe and Reggie were sitting outside
the pavilion at Fenner’s watching the
University against the gentlemen of England,
who as the Babe said, so far from
sitting at home at ease were running out
to Feltham’s slow bowling and getting
caught and stumped, with very enjoyable
frequency. The cricket was a delightful
mixture of a fine bowling performance
and very hard hitting, which to the uneducated
spectator is perhaps the most
lively of all to watch. Feltham had in
fact, from the Babe’s point of view, just
sent down the ideal over. The first ball
was hit out of the ground for six, the
second bowled the hitter round his legs.
The third ball was hit by the incomer for
four, and the fourth for four. The fifth
ball he also attempted to hit as hard as he
could to square leg, and he was caught at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_300" id="page_300">{300}</a></span>
point, in the manner of a catch at the
wicket.</p>

<p>The Babe tilted his hat over his eyes,
and gave a happy little sigh.</p>

<p>“Reggie, the tripos is the secret of
life,” he said. “If you want to get a real
feeling of leisure and independence, a
feeling that you have been told privately
by the archangels to amuse yourself and
do nothing whatever else, go in for the
tripos, or rather wait till you come out. I
suppose that considering my years I have
wasted more time than most people, and
I thought I knew what it felt like. But I
didn’t. I had no idea how godlike it is
to do nothing. To have breakfast, and
feel that it won’t be lunch-time for four
hours, and after that to have the whole
afternoon before you.”</p>

<p>“When are the lists out?”</p>

<p>“Oh, in about ten days now. Don’t
talk about lists. Tell me how long you
worked this morning. Tell me about the
man in your college who works ten hours
every day and eleven hours every night.
Tell me of the difficulty of learning by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_301" id="page_301">{301}</a></span>
heart the Roman emperors or the kings
of Israel and Judah. Assure me that by
knowing the angle of the sun above the
horizon and the length of Feltham’s
shadow, you could find out how tall the
umpire is.”</p>

<p>“He’s about five foot ten,” said
Reggie.</p>

<p>“That’s like the answers I used to
give to the questions about the hands of
a watch,” said the Babe. “They tell you
that if the hands of a watch are together
at twelve&mdash;there’s no ‘if’ about it, it is
never otherwise,&mdash;when will they be together
next. I always said about five
minutes past one. It seems absurdly simple.
I’ve often noticed them together-then:
and the same remark applies to
about ten minutes past two. That reminds
me,” added the Babe, looking at
his watch, “that it’s twenty-five minutes
past five. The hour hand seems to have
gained a little.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember,” said Reggie. “The
hour hand gains seven-elevenths.”</p>

<p>“Seven-elevenths of what?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_302" id="page_302">{302}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Of the answer, I suppose.
I shouldn’t have thought it was
five yet.”</p>

<p>“But it is, and that compels us to decide
between tea and cricket.”</p>

<p>“We can get tea in the pavilion.
There’s another four.”</p>

<p>“You shall give me a hundred to one
that the next ball is not a wicket,” said
the Babe.</p>

<p>“In pennies, and make it fifty.”</p>

<p>“Done.”</p>

<p>A very audible click, and an appeal.
Reggie got up and felt in his pockets.</p>

<p>“I should have been ashamed to get
out to a ball like that. You’ll have to
pay for tea, Babe. There you are.”</p>

<p>“Twopence more,” said the Babe.</p>

<p>“Not if I went to the stake for it,
Hullo, Ealing, where are you from?
Ealing’s got a glorious post-tripos face
too. He really deserves to be able to
play ‘Praise the Lord, ye heavens, adore
Him,’ but he can’t even now.”</p>

<p>“Composed by Mr. Haydn,” said Ealing,
“and performed by Mr. Ealing. It con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_303" id="page_303">{303}</a></span>tains
a very difficult passage. Your left
hand has to go to the left, and your right
hand to the right. You feel all pulled in
two. Babe, the tripos is the noblest of
inventions. I think I shall go in for a
second part. I can quite understand how
the lower classes get in such boisterous
spirits on bank holidays that they change
hats with each other.”</p>

<p>“I’d change hats with&mdash;with a bishop,”
said the Babe, looking wildly about for
suggestions.</p>

<p>“So would I. Or with Longridge.
He wears a blue cake hat. Hullo, they’re
all out.”</p>

<p>“Come and have tea, then,” said Reggie.
“The Babe stands tea.”</p>

<p>“Hang the expense,” said the Babe,
recklessly. “When a man’s got some
tin, what can he do better than to give
his pals a real blow out? I’ve got four
shillings. Tea for three, and bread and
butter for two. The fortune of the Rothschilds
sprang from these small economies.
Bread and butter for two will be plenty.
I’m sure none of us can be very hungry<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_304" id="page_304">{304}</a></span>
on so warm a day. Oh, there’s a tuft-hair
drinking out of a tall glass. I expect
it’s gin-sling. What is gin-sling? In any
case you can’t say it ten times. Ging-slin.”</p>

<p>“I thought you could always say Ranjitsinghi,
Babe.”</p>

<p>“I can when other people are just unable
to. Sufficient champagne gives me
a wonderful lucidity, followed by sleepiness.
There’s Stewart. I didn’t know
he came to cricket matches.”</p>

<p>Stewart was delighted to see them.</p>

<p>“But you, Babe, are not fit for the
society of ordinary people,” he said, “your
extreme cheerfulness since your tripos
argues a want of consideration for others.
What have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking at cricket, and also
talking.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so.”</p>

<p>“I have, indeed,” said the Babe. “What
effect does champagne have on you?”</p>

<p>“Why do you ask these sudden questions?”
said Stewart wearily. “It makes
the wings of my soul sprout.”</p>

<p>“The principle is the same. I ate<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_305" id="page_305">{305}</a></span>
lobster salad the other day and drank
port. It did not give me indigestion, but
acute remorse.”</p>

<p>“Remorse for having done so?”</p>

<p>“No, a vague searching remorse for all
the foolish things I had done, and all the
foolish things I meant to do, and for being
what I was. Food doesn’t affect your
body, it affects your soul. Conversely,
sermons which are supposed to affect your
soul make you hungry.”</p>

<p>Stewart lit a match thoughtfully against
the sleeve of his coat.</p>

<p>“The Babe has hit on a great truth,”
he said. “A curious instance occurred
to my knowledge two years ago. A
strong healthy man read <i>Robert Elsmere</i>.
It gave him so severe an attack of dyspepsia
that he had to spend the ensuing
winter on the Riviera and eat pepsine instead
of salt for eighteen months. Then
he died. The phenomenon is well established.
Poor Simpson, the fellow of my
college, as you know, broke his leg the
other day. It was supposed to have happened
because he tripped and fell down<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_306" id="page_306">{306}</a></span>stairs.
But he told me himself that he
was just leaving his room, and that as he
walked down stairs he read the first few
pages of <i>Stephen Remarx</i>. It was that,
of course, that broke his leg, and so he
fell down stairs as soon as he tried to put
it to the ground. The Babe is quite
right. Sermons, as he told us, make him
hungry and lobster and port remorseful.
In the same way, high tea, if frequently
taken, will make anyone a non-conformist,
in the same way as incense induces Roman
Catholicism. But, Babe, don’t tell Longridge.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“He will want to talk about it to me,
and then I shall be taken with melancholy
madness. Are you coming up for another
year, Babe?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I should like to. Of
course it will depend on my getting
through. If I do, I think a note from my
tutor to my father might have a wholesome
effect.”</p>

<p>“Your tutor will do whatever you wish
him to,” said Stewart. “At present he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_307" id="page_307">{307}</a></span>
going back to college. I have a hansom
waiting because I hate walking. Do any
of you want a lift?”</p>

<p>The others stayed up till stumps were
drawn, and walked down together. The
tea no doubt had affected the Babe’s soul
in some subtle manner, producing acute
fatuity.</p>

<p>The Babe spent the remaining ten days
in assiduous inaction. He sat in canoes,
he sat on benches watching cricket, he
ate, he slept. He appeared at the Senate
house on the morning when the lists were
read out, in pumps, in pink pyjamas, a
long great-coat, and a straw hat. Reggie,
who stood next him, thought he
detected signs of nervousness, when the
names began to be read, but it is probable
that he was mistaken, for the Babe had
never before been known to be afflicted
with that distressing malady. A large number
of his more intimate friends were there,
and an air of suspense was abroad. But
it was over sooner than any one anticipated,
for the Babe, contrary to the expectation
of even the most sanguine of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_308" id="page_308">{308}</a></span>
all, and that was himself, came out first in
the second class. There was one moment’s
pause of astonishment, not unmingled
with awe, and then a wild
disorderly scene of riot and shouting
arose, in which the Babe was seized and
taken back to Trinity in a triumphal procession,
which carried him over the grass
in the great court, wholly disregarding
the porters who gibbered helplessly around
them, until Stewart appeared, who, however,
instead of instantly stopping it,
seemed to take sympathetic interest in
the proceeding.</p>

<p>Later in the day he wrote a charming
letter to the Babe’s father, in which he
congratulated him on his son’s brilliant
success, alluded to his keen historical
instinct and his vivid grasp of events&mdash;whatever
a vivid grasp may be&mdash;and
stated (which was undoubtedly true), that
if certain five men out of the whole University
had not happened to go in for the
same tripos the same year, the Babe
would infallibly have been Senior Historian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_309" id="page_309">{309}</a></span></p>

<p>An answer came later to Stewart and
the Babe. The latter’s was short but
satisfactory. Reggie was breakfasting
with him when the post came in, or rather
he was waiting without any excess of patience
while the Babe, whom he had just
pulled out of bed, explained precisely how
it was that he was not dressed yet, and
urged him not to begin, or if he insisted
on doing so, to play fair.</p>

<p>At this moment the porter entered with
the letter, and the Babe snatched it from
his hand, tore it open, and executed a <i>pas
seul</i> round the room, until he stepped on
the kettle lid, and hurt himself very much.</p>

<p>“The Babe B.A. will be in residence
another year,” he shouted. “You may
eat all the breakfast, if you like.”</p>

<p>Reggie had a healthy appetite, and the
Babe was rather plaintive about it.</p>

<p>Stewart, who had received a letter from
the Babe’s father by the same post, looked
in after breakfast with congratulations.</p>

<p>“I am delighted,” he said, “but, in a
way, disappointed, and for this reason: I
was looking forward to your <i>denoûement</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_310" id="page_310">{310}</a></span>
with some interest, and I should have
found a melancholy pleasure in seeing
how you would make your exit from
Cambridge, and what piece of extraordinary
folly would have been your last. It
seems I shall have to wait another year
for that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t mind me,” said the Babe,
shrilly. “Say you’re sorry I’m coming
up again straight out, if you like.”</p>

<p>“No. On the whole, I don’t mind
waiting another year,” said Stewart.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
